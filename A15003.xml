            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Maior, Aldermen and Burgeſſes, and the reſt of the Inhabitants of the Towne and Pariſh of <hi>Banburie: the Author dedicateth the following Treatiſe, and wiſheth all happines.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Orſhipfull and welbeloued, I haue (not long ſince) preached amongſt you ſome things, concerning the nature of the New Birth. I am glad to vnderſtand, that in handling of them, I gaue to ſome of you ſome good content. I am willing (you ſee) to renew your content, by offering the ſame things now to your eyes, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly to your eares; that the ſerious (and I hope) often reading, of what you but once heard, may inſtruct you better, and ground you further, in this neceſſarie do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. And, Oh that the Lord of Heauen would pleaſe ſo effectually to co-operate with his Word, that many of you may become partakers of this happy and ſauing worke of grace! My greateſt couetouſneſſe is, that your ſoules may be thus inriched; my greateſt ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they may be thus aduanced. To this end haue I bent mine endeauours amongſt you in the conſtant imployment of the talent lent me by God: which, how heartily doe I wiſh and pray, that it may be auaileable for your renouation! For in truth, the whole world is not worthy to ſtand in compariſon, with this life of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines. I ſay it againe, All the greateſt aduancements, profits, pleaſures (which this prick of earth, this almoſt nothing, which we tread vpon, is able to afford), are in no ſort to be eſteemed deſirable; if they be laid in the ballance, againſt thoſe heauenly preferments, thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite treaſures, thoſe vnutterable comforts; whereto
<pb facs="tcp:3455:4"/> this eſtate of grace doth bring thoſe that are brought vnto it, euen in this preſent world in ſome good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: but moſt fully in the vpper region of this world, the ſtately pallace of heauen, the faireſt roome of this large houſe, and the Preſence Chamber of the King of Kings. Why then is any man, eſpecially why is any of you (to whom theſe things haue been frequently deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, on whom they haue been earneſtly preſſed, on whom they are conſtantly inculcated; why (I ſay) is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you) ſo worſe then childiſh, yea, then brutiſh, as to be careleſſe of ſeeking that vnſpeakable felicity, from which nothing can hinder you, but your owne ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full negligence, or wilfull careleſneſſe, in not vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing to ſeeke it? This ſmall Treatiſe I am now bold to dedicate vnto you; both that it may witneſſe to your owne conſciences, and all that reade it, that none of you doth want grace for want of meanes to get it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on Chriſts part, the King of your ſoules, or on my part, his vnworthy Ambaſſadour: and alſo that it may be preſent with you at all times, to prouoke you to get that holineſſe, without which (you haue learned, that) you cannot be ſaued. Accept (I pray you) of this my labour, as a teſtimony of my deſire of your ſoules wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; and make this one onely ſufficient recompence of this, and all other my trauel amongſt you, in receiuing the grace that God offers; and ſtriuing to bee ſuch, as here you may find, that all the citizens of heauen muſt bee, euen men regenerate. So with my moſt feruent prayers to God for your proſperitie, I kindly take my leaue; reſting (ſo long as the ouer-weightineſſe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-toylſomneſſe of the place ſhall ſuffer) your Paſtor,</p>

So hath our Sauiour gotten a new Scholar into his Schoole, and therefore enters him (as it was fit hee ſhould, though hee were for other learning a great Scholar) into the very A, B, C, of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and begins to teach him the firſt principles and rudiments of the doctrine of ſaluation. The points of doctrine, wherein our Lord inſtructeth this Ruler and Doctor are two; in themſelues eaſie enough,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3455:6"/> yet the firſt and eaſieſt of them goes much aboue his carnall and ſhallow capacitie. The firſt point is of the perſons that ſhall be ſaued; the ſecond, is of the cauſes of ſaluation and damnation. The former is in this verſe propounded, and after to the thirteenth in more words diſcuſſed, vpon occaſion of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> his groſſe and vn-Doctor-like obiection: for which groſſeneſſe, hee being gently reprehended, giues Chriſt leaue to proceede in the ſecond, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, from the thirteenth verſe to the two and twentieth. So then the words read, containe the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry foundation and corner-ſtone, as I may terme it, of the doctrine of Chriſtianitie, which Chriſt ſeekes to lay faſt, in the heart of the honeſt-hearted, but (for all his great learning) ignorant <hi>Nicedemus.</hi> The words themſelues draw vs to two conſiderable points in them; the proofe; the doctrine prooued. The proofe, Chriſts authoritie and word, deliuered in an earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-doubled aſſeueration; <hi>Verily, verily, I</hi> (whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou didſt confeſſe to be a Teacher ſent of God) <hi>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3455:7"/> the Scriptures. Marke then, I pray you, this moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie inſtruction, and learne you (if you haue not hitherto learned) at this time, that which this ancient Teacher in Iſrael was firſt ſet to learne, that <hi>No man can be ſaued, vnleſſe he be regenerate.</hi> No perſon, be he Iew or Gentile, Chriſtian or Pagan, Phariſie or of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſect, Ruler or of inferiour place, learned or vnlet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, Doctor or of lower degree; no perſon, I ſay, of what Nation, condition, wit, knowledge, vertue or other excellencie ſo euer he be, can poſſibly ſee (that is, enioy), the Kingdome of God (that is the bliſſefull eſtate of heauenly glory), if he be not borne againe (that is made quite a new man, from that that hee was in his firſt birth): not (as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> too too groſſely fancied) by a carnall re-entring into his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers belly; but by a ſpirituall renewing of his whole man, in all the powers thereof. There is a totall, and abſolute impoſſibilitie of any mans being admitted into the place and ſtate of celeſtiall happines, vnleſſe he be regenerate. Sooner may Angels tume diuels; men beaſts; and beaſts ſtones; &amp; all the world iuſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; then that any one vnrenewed perſon, ſhal haue entrance into heauen. Yea, as poſſible is it, that God ſhould ceaſe to bee God, as that any man, not made a-new according to the image of God, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued into the bleſſed viſion, poſſeſſion, fruition of God; and of all vtterly impoſſible things, this is (if of ſuch things there might be any compariſon) one of the moſt impoſſible; that there ſhould bee any communion betwixt God and man (by Gods parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating his fauour and bleſſedneſſe vnto man), ſo long as man remaineth in the eſtate of his corrupted
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3455:7"/> nature, not being created according to God, in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and true holineſſe. It neither is now, nor euer was, nor euer ſhall bee found, that any man ſhould get within the gates of the kingdome of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; vnleſſe he haue firſt entred into the kingdome of grace, through the Churches narrow wombe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. A new birth, is abſolutely needfull to an eternall life: and in a word, regeneration of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect neceſſity to ſaluation. It were a matter euen ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuperfluous,, to ſeeke more proofes, after ſuch a teſtimony, of ſuch a witneſſe (or author rather) as Chriſt is. But the vnbeleeuing ſpirit of man doth ſtand in neede of ouer-abundant conuiction, in truthes of this ſtraine. Wherefore I will a while ſtand to make good this point, and then (after expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) proceed to apply it. Firſt, we may reade <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiel</hi> crying out to the old Church, in theſe words, <hi>Make you a new heart, and a new ſpirit,</hi>

                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 51.</note> as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh of himſelfe. Firſt, by imputation of the ſinne of our firſt parents, which is ours; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did it in each of our ſteads, in whom, each of vs was then originally comprehended; and then by transfuſion (becauſe wee are branches of that bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter root), we are each of vs become ſonnes of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, ſubiects to the God of this world, ſlaues to ſinne, captiues vnder the dominion and power of luſt, hauing our vnderſtandings darkened, and harts hardened: ſo that, we can neither conceiue, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the things of God; but are led of Satan, at his pleaſure, to doe his will, according as hee doth effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually worke in vs. In a word, wee are enemies to God, heires of death, children of the diuell, dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes, doing the luſts of the fleſh and of the minde, and by nature ſonnes of wrath and deſtruction, one as well as another. A man in the ſtate of corrupt nature, is nothing elſe but a filthy dunghill of all abominable vices: hee is a ſtinking rotten carrion, become altogether vnprofitable and good for nothing: his heart is the diuels ſtore-houſe, an heape of odious luſts; his tongue is a fountaine of curſing and bitterneſſe, and rotten communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; his hand is a miſchieuous inſtrument of filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, deceit, and violence; his eyes great thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fares of luſt, pride, and vanity; his feet are ſwift en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3455:9"/> mouing ſtrongly to reuenge, wantonneſſe and lucre; his life a long chaine of ſinfull actions, euery later linke being more wicked then the former: yea it is but (as it were) one continued web of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, ſpun out, and made vp, by the hands of the diuell and the fleſh, an euill ſpinner, and a worſe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. He brings into the world with him, the kernell of all impiety and iniuſtice, euen an aptneſſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to all the fouleſt acts, that lie within the poſſibility of his naturall ſtrength and meanes to performe, either againſt the Lord, or againſt his neighbour; and an vtter vnaptneſſe and inability to doe any thing (that in the true iudgement and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of God, who onely can iudge aright in this caſe), is, or may bee termed good, as anſwerable to his law. In his ſoule and body there lies the ſpawne of all wickedneſſe: of Atheiſme, of pride, of vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, of hypocriſie, of rebellion, of impatiencie, of hatred and contempt of God, and of his word, of indeuotion, of prophanneſſe, of ambition, of wrath, of filthineſſe, of worldlineſſe, of arrogancie, of ſelfe-conceitedneſſe, of murthers, of whoredomes, of thefts, of periuries, and whatſoeuer thing beſides, is hatefull to God, and contrary to his moſt holy law. He is wholly darkneſſe, wholly fleſh, wholly and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally oppoſite to the liuing God; to whoſe law, hee neither is ſubiect, nor will, nor can be, till he be caſt into an other, and a fairer mould, by the working of his ſpirit. Such a thing as this (my brethren), euen iuſt ſuch a thing and none other, is a man, euen eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man; ſuch an one am I, are you, are all, and each of all, the ſonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> that haue been, are, or

                  <hi>They are all gone out of the way, they are all become vnprofitable, there is none that doth good, no not one.</hi> All theſe words, and more then all theſe, or all that can be ſpoken by vs, falls farre ſhort, of a full deſcription of mans naturall ſinfulnes. For if the tongue it ſelfe (one poore and little member) may well be intitled,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.6.</note> (as it is intitled by the pen of S. <hi>Iames) a world of wickedneſſe;</hi> then alas, how many, and how great worlds of wickedneſſe, are included in this one little world of man? Now how ſhould ſo foule, ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, ſo polluted a creature, ſet his foote within the portall of heauen? How ſhould ſuch an heape of hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh luſts, and diuelliſh vices, bee receiued into that happie palace, and holy manſion place, of Saints, and Angels? What was the reaſon that the diuell could not tarie in heauen, hauing once been there? was it not becauſe he had infected himſelfe with ſinne? with which, ſeeing all mankinde are whollie poyſoned, and couered ouer from head to foote, being of their father the diuell, nothing elſe but euen little diuels, differing from the great ones, not in ſubſtance and parts of corruption, but alone in the degrees thereof, (as a childe of foure or fiue yeeres, from a man of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or fortie): how can hee poſſibly finde any place in the kingdome of heauen? Thus therefore we conclude our reaſon: Sinne can haue no place, no dwelling, none intertainment in the kingdome of God. Man vnregenerate is nothing elſe, but a very compound, or bundle, of dirt and ſinne. Wherefore man vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, cannot poſſibly finde a place in heauen. And this is the firſt reaſon, from the ſinfulneſſe of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                  <note place="margin">From the purity of Gods nature.</note>The ſecond followes, taken from the puritie of Gods nature. The Lord is a God of pure eyes, and can abide none iniquitie, yea the wicked and the workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie his ſoule hateth. Hee is as contrary to ſinne, as heate to colde, as light to darkneſſe, as any two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie things in the world can be imagined to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and a great deale more too. For other things are contrary each to other alone in regard of their quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But the very nature, ſubſtance, and being of God, is contrary to ſinne. For ſinne is a taxie, diſorder, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, a not being; and God is order, perfection, holineſſe, an abſolute, and a ſimple being. For holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in God is not an accident, but his very eſſence is holineſſe, and he is after an inconceiueable and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible manner, infinitly, and eſſentially, good, holy, and pure. Wherefore there can be no reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor vnion, betwixt him and the ſinner, till the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of the ſinner be remoued, and the image of God be formed and imprinted in him a freſh. Euen as the poiſon of an Adder is contrary to the nature of a man, and the venome of a Toade extreamly oppoſite to his life: and therefore no force can compell, no wages hire, no Rhetorique perſwade, no perſwaſion induce him, to lodge a Toade, or Serpent, in his boſome; ſo is it impoſſible that the moſt holy, pure, righteous, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect eſſence of God, ſhould admit into a ſocietie of grace and glorie with him, the impure, filthie, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, toadlike, ſerpentine nature of man. For though the infinit perfection &amp; excellencie of Gods nature be ſuch, that he cannot receiue any hurt or indamageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from ſin; as a man is hurt by the poyſon of a poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full creature: yet ſtill withal, ſuch is his excellencie, and the infinitnes of his power and goodneſſe, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3455:10"/> but remoue farre and farre from himſelfe, al things whatſoeuer that are contrary vnto himſelfe. What fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip can there be betwixt light &amp; darkneſſe? God and wickedneſſe? How can things abſolutely and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially contrary, be ioyned together in one? Seeing God is perfectly holy, and man (if we may vſe that epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thite in this matter) perfectly ſinfull; either God muſt become ſinfull like to man, or man holy like to God, or elſe there can be no gratious vnion and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion betwixt man and God. Now to imagine that God ſhould become ſinfull, is the moſt blaſphemous and vtterly impoſſible imagination in all the world. Wherefore vnleſſe a man be made holy, (that is to ſay, be regenerate, or borne againe) he cannot ſee the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.</p>
               <p>In the third place let vs peruſe the couenant of grace, <label type="milestone">

Now vntill a man be regenerate he is a ſtranger to that couenant. For why, that promiſeth in the firſt place a new heart, and a new ſpirit: wherefore it muſt needes follow, that vntill a man be regenerate, hee cannot be ſaued.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, let vs conſider the end of our Sauiour Chriſts <label type="milestone">

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3455:11"/> that we being ſanctified by his truth, might auoid the corruptions that are in the world through luſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a peculiar people vnto him, zealous of good workes. Doubtleſſe had Chriſt gone about to ranſome vs vpon other termes, he muſt haue loſt his labour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together. If Chriſt ſhould come, and dye, for one man, ten thouſand times; all thoſe deaths ſhould profit that one man nothing at all for his ſaluation, vnleſſe he be made a new creature. For the death of Chriſt, though it be of force to reconcile mercie and iuſtice in God, yet is not of force enough to make God vniuſt, or to diminiſh any whit his infinite righteouſneſſe; which ſhould be diminiſhed (yea annihilated), if he ſhould open the gates of heauen, to vnholy, vnſanctified, vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate perſons: for then ſhould he be a louer of the wicked, then ſhould fooles dwel with him, then ſhould hee haue fellowſhip with the vnrighteous, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the darkeſt darkneſſe. Whereas the Scripture ſaith that he is light,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.5.</note> and in him is no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; and that if we walke in darknes, and ſay, wee haue communion with him, we lie, and deale not truly. For al that are in heauen are loued of God, and haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him. Wherefore ſuch admittance of ſuch men into heauen, can no more ſtand with Gods iuſtice, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it can ſtand with a mans life to be caſt into the bottome of the ſea. For this cauſe, it was neuer the meaning, or intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our Sauiour, to open heauen to any, but to thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he would ſanctifie, and by ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification bring to ſaluation. And ſo we conclude the point in this manner: Whoſoeuer is without Chriſt, cannot poſſibly come to heauen. For he is the way, the truth, and the life. Euery vnregenerate man is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, for all that are in him are new creatures,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3455:11"/> hauing crucified the fleſh, with the affections &amp; luſts. Therefore no vnregenerate man, ſo continuing, can ſee the kingdome of God.</p>

Now this worke is in this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſet out by all the cauſes, and by the ſubiect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The cauſes are foure, all briefly named in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. The efficient, formall, materiall, and finall. The efficient is double, principall, and inſtrumentall. The principall, the ſole author (in whom remaineth all the power of working, and to whom all the praiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth) is the Spirit of God, the Holy Ghoſt, the third Perſon in Trinitie. The ſame Spirit by whom our Sauiour Chriſts Man-hood was conceiued in his Mothers wombe, is the ſole worker of this conception of grace in the heart of Chriſtians. So doth our Lord himſelfe inſtruct <hi>Nicodemus</hi> in the words following, ſaying,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>verſ.</hi> 6.</note> 
                  <hi>That that is borne of the ſpirit, is ſpirit:</hi> and before Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> had told vs, that beleeuers were <hi>borne, not of blood,</hi>

                  <hi>nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man;</hi> that is, not by any natural power, vertue, or ſtrength, which is naturally inherent in them; but of God, that is, of the Spirit of God: wherefore in the New Couenant,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3455:12"/> the promiſe is made on this wiſe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.16.</note> 
                  <hi>I will put my ſpirit in your hearts:</hi> and in another place, <hi>I will poure forth my ſpirit vpon all fleſh.</hi> The ſpirit of God that reſts vpon our Sauiour Chriſt, doth deſcend fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, vnto thoſe that ſhall bee his members; at the ſame time implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them into him, and imprinting his image vpon them. No Angell can change mans heart, no Angell can quicken the dead ſoule, no creature can breath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs the diuine nature: but we are the workmanſhip of God, by his ſpirit created vnto good workes. This is the annointing oyle, that being poured vpon vs, doth conſecrate vs vnto God. The holy Ghoſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (in a wonderfull and vndiſcernable faſhion, as the winde that bloweth where it luſteth) doth conueigh and inſinuate himſelfe into the man, whom hee will beget againe to a new life, and becommeth purifying water to cleanſe him; and an holy fier, comming downe from heauen, to conſume his corruptions, and refine him for the Lords vſe. And yet the Spirit of God, that could work of himſelf, and without meanes, pleaſeth not ſo to doe in this great worke: but of his owne free-will, makes choice for himſelfe, of a fit and bleſſed inſtrument for that purpoſe; euen the Law of God, the whole doctrine of the Scriptures: which hee hath for that end, made knowne to the ſonnes of men by his holy Prophets; and which hath receiued this high commendation, from the Diuine teſtimonie left in writing by <hi>Dauids</hi> pen, that it is perfect,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 19.</note> and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the ſoule. This doctrin hath two maine heads; the Law, and the Goſpel: The former vſed by Gods Spirit, as a neceſſarie preparatiue; the other, as a proper &amp; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in this buſines. Wherfore the Word is called the incorruptible ſeede, which being ſowne in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3455:13"/> the heart,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23.</note> doth by little and little grow vp to a new creature; and <hi>Peter</hi> tels vs, that by the pretious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.</note> we are made partakers of the diuine nature; and to his Apoſtles our Sauiour vttereth as much, ſaying, <hi>Now are you cleane by the word that I haue ſpoken vnto you.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 15.3.</note> There may be a queſtion made, whither the Word of God read onely, may become effectuall to regenerate? or whither it muſt want this efficacie, vnleſſe it bee preached, as well as read? To which queſtion, mee thinketh that this ſhould be a true anſwere, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall power of regenerating cannot be denied to the Scriptures barely read, though preaching bee not ioyned withall. For why? ſeeing the doctrine of the Goſpell is called,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8.</note> the miniſtration of the Spirit, and it is the doctrine of the Goſpell, when it is offered to the vnderſtanding by bare reading; therfore it muſt follow, that in ſuch caſe alſo, it may become the power of God to ſaluation, and the inſtrument of the ſpirit to regeneration. The ſame precepts, promiſes and threats are by reading, deliuered to the mind of the man that readeth, or heareth the Word read; and why then ſhould we thinke, that the Holy Ghoſt either cannot, or will not, worke together with them? Yea doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he can doe it when hee will, and will doe it then, whenſoeuer he doth not (as often he doth not) affoord to men a poſſibilitie of enioying any other helpe then reading. Vnleſſe the not being preached, could make the Word not to be the Law of God: I ſee no reaſon that it ſhould bee thought vnable to conuert ſoules, without being preached. But withall wee muſt adde this, that the Word of God is made effectuall by the Spirit, more often, more vſually, more ordinarily, to beget a new life, in the preaching (that is to ſay, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3455:13"/> and applying of it, by the mouth of a man, inabled and aſſigned to that worke) then in the bare reading: for the Lord hath appointed in his Church, Paſtors and Teachers to be his Workemen, his Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Diſpenſers of his heauenly myſteries, and Fellow-workemen together with him; that by becomming his inſtruments, to conueigh grace into mens hearts, they might become ſpirituall Fathers vnto them; and by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance (not to reading alone,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 13.</note> but alſo) to doctrine or teaching, they might ſaue themſelues and their hearers. And when Chriſt himſelfe was pleaſed to raiſe vp the dead world of the Gentiles, vnto the new life of godlineſſe (and ſo to fulfill that which himſelfe had foretold, ſaying,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.25.</note> 
                  <hi>The dead ſhall heare the voice of the Sonne of God, and they that heare it ſhall liue</hi>). Hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Diſciples to goe and preach vnto all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: will any man make himſelfe ſo ſimple, as to ſay,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19.</note> he meant thus; Take the volume of the Law in your pockets, and draw it out, and reade a Chapter or two at a time vnto them? Nay doubtleſſe, hee willed his Diſciples to do that, which they had ſo often ſeene and heard him doing; whoſe cuſtome was (as wee may col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect out of the fourth of <hi>Luke,</hi> where one inſtance is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, to make vs conceiue his ordinarie practice), when he had read, to interpret the Scripture by him read, as there he did, ſaying, <hi>This day is this Scripture ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in your eares:</hi> and after to apply it to the hearers, as in the ſame place, he falles into the reproofe of their quarrelſomneſſe againſt him, that would vpbraide him with the Prouerb of, Phyſitian heale thy ſelfe;<note place="margin">Prouerb.</note> amplify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his reproofe, with allegation of the examples of the Widdow of <hi>Zarepta,</hi> and the Syrian <hi>Naaman.</hi> So the Apoſtles could not miſtake his meaning, when
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3455:14"/> himſelfe had by conſtant practice gone before you, in doing what he bad them doe. And therefore it will not at all follow, that becauſe the word read, is able to beget faith; either the miniſters may content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vſually to reade it, without preaching: or the people vſually content themſelues to heare it ſo; and not be carefull to ſeeke for the preaching of it. For of ſuch abſolute neceſſity, and of ſuch excellent worth is regeneration, that it is needfull to ſeeke it, (and ſinfull not to ſeeke it) not onely in ſome one of the moſt eaſie meanes that may ſometimes procure it; but alſo in all the meanes (though neuer ſo painfull) that God hath appointed for it. Euery man may reade himſelfe, yea muſt reade, if he can. This is a duty that might haue beene performed, without eſtabliſhing of any mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in the Church. But the Miniſter is, not onely to reade; but alſo to diuide the word of truth aright, to exhort, improue, rebuke, to ſpeake to mens edification, exhortation &amp; comfort; that he may be truly called a fellow-labourer with God, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> work of mens ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Shal we reſt our ſelues ſatisfied in one thing, that may conuert? ſhall we thinke it enough to bee conſtant in one exerciſe, that may worke grace? Doubtleſſe if wee doe ſo, our owne worldly wiſdome and diligence ſhal riſe vp in iudgement, and condemne our ſpirituall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and negligence. Yea brethren, in things temporall, men ſtand thus affected: that as they will neglect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that may promiſe them any furtherance to their good ſucceſſe; ſo they will ſhew moſt care, and moſt earneſtneſſe, in that which they haue cauſe to thinke, will be moſt auaileable for their purpoſe. Now without queſtion, the word preached is more vſually, and more powerfully effectuall to regeneration, then
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3455:14"/> the word read. The holy Ghoſt doth more often, and more mightily worke by the word interpreted, and applied, then by it barely repeated out of the booke. I thinke him not worthy to bee reaſoned withall, that will ſtand in deniall of this matter. Reade the ſtories of holy writ, and ſearch and ſee, if the examples of men by onely reading regenerated, bee not few, rare, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; nay ſcarce any where at all to be found: but on the other ſide, the examples of men by preaching made new, common, frequent, and vſuall. Therefore be it againe concluded, that he doth farre vnderualue the gift of ſpiritual life; which ſatisfying himſelf in the leſſe vſuall, and leſſe auaileable meanes of working it, becauſe it is moſt eaſie; pretermitteth the more auail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and more vſuall, becauſe he is not willing to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the paines, labour, or coſt that it will require. And thus you haue the efficient cauſes of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Gods ſpirit as the chiefe, the word principally preached, as his inſtrument. The materiall cauſe is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, that is the thing, in the working of which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation is conuerſant: Holineſſe (I ſay) the moſt admirable of all things in all the world: as farre ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing wit, and learning, and riches, and other earthly vanities; as learning ſurpaſſeth ignorance, and wealth beggery. This is (as it were) the character of Chriſt Ieſus, the image of God, the beauty, the riches, the ſtrength, the life, the ſoule, of the ſoule &amp; of the whole man: It is a very beame of the diuine light, called therefore by the Apoſtle, The diuine nature; it is the moſt excellent and worthy thing vnder heauen, or (of things incident to creatures) in heauen. It is that, that diſtinguiſheth Angels from diuels; the Saints, from the damned Ghoſts. Take away from a bleſſed Angell
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3455:15"/> his holineſſe, he will become a blacke fiend of hell. It is (in a word) the beſt of all things that a creature can haue; without which nothing is worth the hauing; and with which the meaneſt condition is able to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord a man happineſſe enough. This admirable thing, that can by no words be ſufficiently commended, is giuen by regeneration; and therefore wee call it the matter of regeneration. Now holineſſe is nothing elſe but this, a ſupernaturall power of withdrawing the faculties of the whole man from ſinfull and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obiects, and exerciſing the ſame vpon God, and the things of God. This <hi>Adam</hi> had in his firſt creation, and that in ſuch perfection as God required at his hand. This ſhould hee haue propagated to his ſonne; and his ſonne, to his ſonne, had he continued in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency: ſo that to him the ſame thing was naturall (and to his innocent poſterity ſhould haue been), which now to vs is aboue the power and courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to attaine; and therefore need wee to get it by a ſecond birth, becauſe wee cannot get it in our firſt birth. For the naturall man doth not conceiue in his mind (and conſequently neither apply his will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to receiue) the things of God,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.</note> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh: yea his minde is alwayes bowing and bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after either bare earthly, or very helliſh obiects: but becauſe theſe things muſt be ſpiritually diſcerned, therefore the holy Ghoſt endues him with a new po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of raiſing himſelfe vp, from theſe baſe and filthy matters, vnto his Creator, the eternall fountaine and firſt cauſe of being and of bliſſe, euen vnto the God of heauen; in compariſon of whom, all things are leſſe and worſe then nothing: and likewiſe vnto the things of God, remiſſion of ſinnes, the fauour of God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3455:15"/> with Chriſt Ieſus, encreaſe of holineſſe; and the like to theſe, which are by an excellency called the things of God: becauſe they are the chiefeſt of all thoſe things, that he beſtowes vpon the ſonnes of men; and to the ſeeking whereof, hee directs them in his holy word, whereas elſe they would neuer haue ſought them. This is the materiall cauſe of regeneration. The formall is, infuſion, as witneſſeth the Lord himſelfe, ſaying; <hi>I will poure vpon the houſe of Dauid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10.</note> 
                  <hi>the ſpirit of grace</hi> And in another place, <hi>I will poure flouds vpon the dry ground.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7.</note> 
                  <hi>God hath giuen vs the ſpirit of a right mind.</hi> For whereas ſome qualities are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in men by nature; ſome attained vnto, by their owne induſtry, and by vertue of certaine actions for that purpoſe performed; and ſome againe are wrought in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by a ſupernaturall work of God: this gift of holineſſe, is neither naturally deſcended vnto them, (as it ſhould haue been, had their parents been innocent); nor yet attained by their diligence and paines, or by force and power, of any action done by them: but is put into them, by the ſpirit of God, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aboue and beyond, either their power, or the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the acts that they ſhall doe, for the attaining of it. Let vs make the matter more plainly vnderſtood by compariſons. The power of ſeeing, is naturally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon all men in their very birth, and by the courſe of nature working in their mothers wombe. This power or vſe of this facultie is altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied vnto ſome men, and they are borne ſtarke blinde, as was hee of whom we reade in the Goſpell. Chriſt with ſpettle made cley, and hauing anoynted his eyes, bade him to waſh, and he returned ſeeing. We ſay now that into this man, the power or act of ſeeing was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3455:16"/> for why by nature he could not ſee. The ſpettle, cley, water, had no ſuch naturall force in them, as to worke the power of ſeeing in an eye, that through na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall indiſpoſition, wanted it. Wherefore it muſt needes be infuſed, that is wrought in that perſon, by a ſupernaturall worke of God. So againe, Health is a qualitie; ſickneſſe (for example a burning ague) taketh away this qualitie of health. A man being ſo ſicke, of ſuch a diſeaſe conſulteth with Phyſitians, receiueth po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from them, and recouereth his health: this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie now was acquired, or gotten by paines and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie. For by vertue of ſome inherent qualitie in the medicines receiued, was this qualitie of health reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the body. But a man that was ſick of an ague in the time of <hi>Peter,</hi> ſending to him receiueth a napkin from him, and by the receiuing of it is healed. This health was an infuſed health, for not any power inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the cloth, or deriued from the body of <hi>Peter;</hi> but a ſupernaturall worke of God, did procure that health at the preſence of ſuch outward actions. In like ſort, Holineſſe was to <hi>Adam</hi> a naturall power, or abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie created in him, and with him, and immediatly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying his nature, or iſſuing from it. But the diuell robbed him of it, by taking that from him, and poyſoning him with the contrary naturall impotencie of ſinne, (for I ſuppoſe we may well call ſinne, I meane originall ſinne, a naturall impotencie, or a miſchieuous and corrupt diſorder in all the faculties). Wherefore it is requiſite, that he recouer it againe, if hee ſhall be ſaued. Now the Lord of heauen pleaſeth by meanes of the word (as it were by the ſpettle of his mouth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king cley, to anoynt his eyes) to re-beget or recreate, this qualitie of holineſſe in him; not that the word
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3455:16"/> hath any natural inherent ability of working holineſſe, no more then a napkin of curing an ague; but alone becauſe the Lord ſees it fit, in and with that doctrine to worke this worke, by a power immediatly and ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deriued from himſelfe. So may a man by long ſtudy obtaine the ſcience of naturall Philoſophie, which is a qualitie, and an habit; but the Lord did pleaſe by his owne immediate power, to deriue this ſcience into the minde of <hi>Salomon:</hi> and therefore his knowledge was an infuſed knowledge, and more excellent for meaſure and degree, then euer any man did, or could attaine by ſtudie. So the power of ſpeaking and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding any language, is a quality, which by ſtudy, or cuſtome of hearing and ſpeaking, a man may worke in himſelfe; and he that by much labour and reading gets, for example, his Latin tongue, hath wrought this qualitie in himſelfe; but the Apoſtles had the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſpeaking all, and by name the Latin tongue, put into them ſuddenly, by the immediate operation of the holy Ghoſt, and by vertue of a diuine worke, in an vnconceiueable manner working in their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. So we call holineſſe an infuſed qualitie, becauſe the holy Ghoſt, by vertue of his owne hand, and by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer immediatly deriued from himſelfe, not by vertue of any power naturally dwelling, either in man, or in the Word, doth pleaſe, in and with the word to worke it in man. The ſpirit of life doth breathe it into thoſe in whom it is, and they haue it by the meere effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of his diuine power, not of the meanes in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, conſidered. Neither yet muſt we neglect thoſe exerciſes and ordinances, in and by which it pleaſeth him to co-operate, and to conueigh vnto vs this grace; but rather muſt with all diligence apply our ſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3455:17"/> them; that by making our ſelues ſubiect vnto his bleſſed will, we may likewiſe bee capable of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent worke of his. Though cley made of ſpettle, and the water of Siloah, had no ſuch vertue in them, as to make a blinde eye ſee, and to turne the naturall impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie backe againe into the power of ſeeing; yet the man that was borne blinde, was to vſe that waſhing, and that cley: for elſe his diſobedience to Chriſt, would haue depriued him of the diuine vertue of Chriſt, which vpon his obedience, ſhewed it ſelfe in healing him. So regeneration is not attaineable by vertue of any act or acts, that wee or any creature can doe; but it commeth from aboue, and is effected by an inconceiueable power of Gods ſpirit, (for it muſt needes farre ſurpaſſe the ſtrength of a creature, to change the ſoule, and to cauſe a returne, from ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable a priuation or naturall impotencie, as ſinne is, vnto ſo glorious, bleſſed and excellent an habit, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall abilitie, as that holineſſe is, into which we are transformed). But for all this, he that would haue the holy Ghoſt ſhew his infinite power in making ſuch a change in him; muſt willingly ſubmit himſelfe to the doing of any actions whatſoeuer, wherewithall the ſpirit of God ſhall manifeſt, that it is his pleaſure to ioyne, this his happie and powerfull working. And ſuch is the formall cauſe of regeneration. The finall cauſe, or the end of it, is the glorie of God, in the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the partie regenerate. For to ſpeake truth, it were a ſhame and reproch to the God of heauen, to let a ſinner (that is to ſay, his profeſſed enemie) come into heauen: for this would vpbraide him with falſehood, in regard of his word, and with want of holineſſe and iuſtice in his nature. Now the Lord
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3455:17"/> cannot be ſo weake, as to doe any thing, that ſhould giue him iuſt cauſe (to ſpeake (as of God wee muſt needes ſpeake) after the manner of men) of being aſhamed thereof. Wherefore that he may with glory, and honour, and praiſe, and the content of his owne moſt holy nature, take thither, ſo many of the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> as hee pleaſeth to make veſſels of honour; it is his will and care, thus to change their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to renew them by his ſpirit: and ſo he obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the fulleſt fulneſſe of glorie that may be, in their happineſſe; being for euer praiſed, by all his holy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and (which more is) infinitly ſatisfying himſelfe in the beholding of the excellencie of that great work of their bleſſednes, and the moſt pure and holy and admirable meanes, that hee hath ordained to bring them vnto it. And theſe are the cauſes of regeneration. The next thing mentioned in the deſcription is the ſubiect of it: which is the whole man, in all the powers of the ſoule and of the body, according as the Apoſtle prayeth for the Theſſalonians,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23.</note> that they might bee ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified throughout, and that their whole ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy might be kept blameleſſe. And by this note it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenced from all other changes, that may carrie any reſemblance to it; they being all but partiall changes, either of the outſide alone, and not the inſide; or of ſome one power alone, not of all the powers: becauſe indeed they are not fruites of holineſſe, but either of hollowneſſe, and ſelfe-loue; or at beſt, of a bare and weake worke of illumination. And thus haue I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the firſt thing intended, in deſcribing regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; of which if any man demaund what it is? wee ſay it is a change, that is, a bringing of a new and (here too of a) contrary qualitie, in ſtead of the old that was
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3455:18"/> before; if who makes the change? the holy Ghoſt: if by what meanes? by the word: if in what manner? by infuſion; that is, by the working of a proper and immediate vertue deriued from himſelfe. If from what, and to what this change is? from the ſinfulneſſe of a man (which he receiueth from <hi>Adam</hi> ſucceſſiuely) to holineſſe. If wherein? in the whole man, ſoule and body, and all the powers of both: If to what end? to the glory of the worker, and ſaluation of him in whom it is wrought. O happy worke of an happy workman, by an happy inſtrument! and thrice happy that man, in whom this bleſſed worker ſhall vouchſafe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh this his moſt worthy, and excellent, and onely bleſſed worke, to ſo worthy and bleſſed a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

The Lord doth not alone raiſe vp miſerable terrors of conſcience in him, in regard of ſome one or more groſſe offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3455:18"/> he hath actually committed, (although often hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth theſe very terrors, a meanes of making himſelfe a paſſage to enter in at), but hee opens the eyes of the minde, to ſee the very mud and filth of the ſoule, that lay at the bottome before vnſeene and vndiſcerned. The Spirit conuinceth him of ſinne: It ſhewes him that generall wickednes and ſinfulnes of his nature, whereof we ſpake before. Now he feeles his vnbeliefe, pride, ignorance, hypocriſie, and other heart-corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Hee iudgeth himſelfe worthy to be deſtroyed, not alone hauing a ſight of his own inability to eſcape damnation: but likewiſe of the iuſtice of God in dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him, ſo that hee doth euen ſtoupe and yeeld him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thereto. Whereas before hee was aliue without the Law, not hauing the true knowledg of it, now the Law comming in the ſound power and working of it, through the ſtrength of the holy Ghoſt; cauſeth that he becomes dead in his owne ſenſe, and apprehenſion: but ſinne becomes aliue to his ſenſe and feeling; and hee perceiuing the ſtrength, force, violence, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuouſnes of it, more then euer before, now cryes out with the Apoſtle, <hi>O miſerable man that I am!</hi> and now confeſſeth that he is carnall and ſold vnder ſinne, as the ſame Apoſtle did, in the ſame ſenſe of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall wretchedneſſe, which the comming of the life of grace had brought with it. Thus the death of ſinne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be changed into life, in that it is felt and diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For the very firſt working of this new life, muſt needs be a feeling of the old death in ſinnes and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes: Not (I ſay) alone of his death in hell, in regard of his deſeruing the torments thereof, but of his death in ſinnes and treſpaſſes, of his vtter inabilitie to do any good thing, of his vtter emptines of all heauenly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3455:19"/> of his extreame ſlauerie to vngodlines, and vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, and all the luſts of the fleſh; and of his perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and vehement pronenes to all abomination and wickednes. There is often (I confeſſe) a work, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry terrible work, of the Law &amp; the naturall conſcience together, procuring moſt extreame and hideouſly-bitter pangs, and helliſh agonies in the ſoule of man; where the ſpirit of regeneration neither is, nor euer ſhall be: this being alone a fruite of the ſpirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, not of the ſpirit of grace. And oftentimes againe, the ſpirit of ſanctification comes into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoule, together with this ſpirit of bondage, making a violent entrie, and by maine force breaking open the heart; formerly locked and barred againſt it; and ſo beginning this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing worke of holineſſe. But terrors of conſcience, which may be in all vnregenerate men, (becauſe they are already in all the damned, into whom no part nor peece of regeneration can enter) is farre different from this firſt degree of the worke of a new birth. The ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying ſpirit, laies the filthineſſe, not alone the danger of ſinne, before the eyes of the mind. It cauſeth a man, not alone to be in extreame anguiſh, becauſe he feares he muſt be damned: but euen to loathe and abhorre himſelfe, and to be very vile in his owne eyes, becauſe he knowes hee hath deſerued to be damned: and that ſo foule a thing as ſinne, (wherewith his Maker hath due cauſe to be ſo much diſpleaſed) doth not alone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide, but raigne and command in him. Wherefore hee doth euen lie downe at the foote of the throne of Gods iuſtice, and in a moſt ardent abhorring of himſelfe, doth ſubſcribe to the righteouſnes of God in his owne feared deſtruction; hauing nothing in the world to ſay for himſelfe (as of himſelfe), why he ſhould not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3455:19"/> and not ſo much as a tittle of a word to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect againſt the perfect and exact equitie of the liuing God, if that he ſhould deſtroy him. Sinne, I ſay ſinne, not alone the puniſhment of ſin, but ſin it ſelfe, is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered vnto him: hee ſees its loathſomnes and vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; he ſees its ſtrength and violence; he ſees his owne totall defilement; hee perceiues himſelfe throughly, and throughly polluted with it: and cries out bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Ah what ſhal I doe! not only, nor ſo much, becauſe I ſhall be damned; but becauſe I am ſo wicked, ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſo contrary to God, ſo rebellious againſt him, ſo very a traytor vnto him, and ſo vtterly vnable to mend theſe woful diſorders of my ſoule. Theſe be his groanes, theſe be his plaints, and his cryings out are of his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe and iniquitie, wherein hee was conceiued, wherein hee was borne, wherein hee hath liued; and whereof now he perceiueth not ſo much as one part of his heart, or of his life, to be cleane, and vnſpotted. This acknowledgement and ſenſe of our ſinfulnes, is the very firſt beginning of holineſſe. The vnregenerate often ſees and feeles his damnation; the regenerate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone his ſinfulnes, the miſerable deprauation of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the vtter, totall, odious, pollution of his whole man; being ſo loathſome, that hee ſees God cannot chuſe in iuſtice but deteſt him, and for any thing that is in himſelfe, for euer reiect him. This apprehenſion of ſinfulnes is mixed alwaies at firſt (at leaſt often) with the feare of Gods wrath and vengeance: but it doth ſo temper and allay that feare, as the bitternes thereof, carries not the ſoule furiouſly to contend againſt God, as elſe he could not chuſe but doe. For his hatred is not ſtirred now againſt God, whom in truth (by vertue of a ſecret, vnfelt, and vndiſcerned hope, that the ſpirit of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3455:20"/> God hath created, and doth vphold in him) he loueth, and honoureth, though he be more then half in doubt, leſt hee may deſtroy him: but alone againſt himſelfe, his wretched hatefull ſelfe, that is ſo intollerably wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and naught, that he can ſee no cauſe, but that the Lord ſhould glorifie his equitie and iuſtice, in dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him. And ſo much for this firſt worke of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: the ſecond followes it cloſe at the heeles, and is nothing elſe,<note place="margin">

For you muſt conceiue the partie that is now in regenerating, to haue a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall knowledge of the doctrine of the Goſpell, and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall aſſent alſo to the truth of it: this doctrine being (as I ſaid before) an inſtrumentall cauſe of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But now the generall knowledge begins to bee made ſpeciall, and the man touched with a ſenſe of ſinne, is moued alſo with a moſt vehement longing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grace and mercie; not alone to pardon his ſinne, but alſo to heale his ſoule of it, as of a deſperat wound, which he feeleth to be moſt ſmarting and mortall. So hee cries out, who ſhall deliuer me from this body of death? No hungrie man did euer, with a more eager appetite, wiſh for meate; nor thirſtie man for drinke; nor couetous man for money; nor ambitious man, for aduancement, then hee now longeth to be reconciled vnto God in Chriſt; to haue his foule nature made cleane, his wofull ſinnes forgiuen, his abominable cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions remoued, and killed, and holineſſe planted in their roome. Oh how faine he would be holy! O how faine would hee be humble, faithfull, obedient! how faine he would beleeue in, loue, feare, ſerue God! but, ah wretch that he is, he cannot: Woe, woe, vnto him,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3455:20"/> he cannot. O, how ſhall hee be able to preuaile againſt theſe vile diſorders of his heart, and life? how ſhall hee doe to be leſſe ſinfull, and more righteous? Theſe be his thoughts, theſe his wiſhes, theſe his groanes: hee findes ſo great a miſſe of nothing, as of the pardon of his ſinne, and the graces of the Spirit of God; and if he had that beſtowed vpon him, were he a beggar, a priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, a ſlaue, any thing; yet he ſhould ſeeme to himſelfe an happy man: and, ah Lord, (thinkes he) that thou wouldeſt be pleaſed, for Chriſt his ſake, to forgiue my wickednes, and to heale my nature. Now the thirſt that hee had after the things of this world, is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully cooled; and, (as a man in a burning fit of an ague, makes no reckoning of his fine cloathes) hee doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt put off all thoſe deſires, and poore or not poore, eſteemed or not eſteemed, it is no great matter; but that he might be accepted into the fauour of God, and haue his ſinnes pardoned and ſubdued, and his vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nature made holy, that is all in all within him. There is to be ſeene in vnſanctified men, in caſe of terrors of conſcience, (which ſometimes do lie long vpon them) a great deſire to be free from the inſufferable euils they ſee comming vpon them. For, who can make queſtion, but that <hi>Iudas</hi> would faine not haue been damned? or, that the damned in hell haue not a wonderfull deſire get out of their torments? this being one maine ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauation of their pangs, that they cannot but deſire, to be deliuered out of thoſe euils, which they cannot eſcape. But they, not hauing the ſupportation of the Spirit of God to vnderprop them with hope, doe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh in theſe deſires, and loſe the fruit of them for lack of a kindly working of them towards the Lord: for they be not lifted vp to heauen-ward. But the man that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3455:21"/> is now in framing a new, (being ſuſtained with the fore-mentioned ſecret hope) hath vehement and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led wiſhes, fixed and faſtened in him; whereby hee thirſteth after the grace of God, not alone to ſaue, but alſo to amend him. So the deſires of the ſanctified ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the ſpirit, are differenced from the deſires of the vnſanctified, that are meere fruits of nature, (which would faine be wel eaſed of an heauie burthen) by theſe two things: Firſt, that they are directed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, whereas the other are rouing and confuſed deſires. Secondly, by their being ſet, alwaies, as well (often as much, ſomtimes more) vpon holineſſe, as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on freedome from puniſhment: vpon the getting of vertue and goodneſſe, as vpon the getting of an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly kingdome; wheras the heart of the vnſanctified is ſo taken vp, (when he muſt needs feele it) with the ſenſe of his miſery and puniſhment, that hee cannot haue while to ſettle any part of his longings, vpon the renewing of his ſoule by grace; and ſo farre is the worke of a new birth well proceeded. The poore dead man, being ſo far awakened out of his ſenſeleſſe death in ſinne, that with great diſquietment he feeles it, and with heartieſt workings of his ſoule doth couet to come out of it: which laſt I take to bee the hungring and thirſting after righteouſneſſe; noted by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour as a bleſſed note of bleſſedneſſe.<note place="margin">3. The ſpirit of Prayer.</note> In the third place, there is dropped into him the ſpirit of grace and ſupplications, by which hee is at length imboldened to goe vnto God, and in ſome ſolemne and expreſſe manner, to vtter his confeſſions and petitions; which before (perhaps) for ſome good ſpace of time he could not dare to doe. For the former two workes of grace doe often (a great while together) ſhew themſelues in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3455:21"/> ſighes and grones, and ſudden &amp; ſtrong eiaculations, &amp; ſecret &amp; vndiſſembled boylings vp of deſire, in deep wiſhes &amp; longings, afore the poore ſinner can take ſo much hart to himſelfe, as to make a formed and ſetled prayer vnto God. But after the working of theſe moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſome while, he puts vpon himſelfe the reſolution of the King of Nineueh, and ſaith within himſelfe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ionab.</hi> 3.</note> Let me cry mightily vnto the Lord of heauen &amp; earth; his mercies are infinite, who can tel, but that be may haue mercy vpon me, that I periſh not? (ſo is his ſecret ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining hope, now formed and faſhioned into the right proportion of a ſauing grace, and ſhewes it ſelfe manifeſtly within him), hee ſaith to himſelfe, there is hope concerning this thing; and therefore I will cry, and continue crying, and let the Lord doe what hee pleaſeth vnto me. Then downe vpon his knees he fals, and with his hands and eyes lifted vp to the throne of grace (yet almoſt afraid and aſhamed to looke thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore ready often to riſe vp, and ſtart backe againe), he dares at laſt to poure forth his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable confeſſions into Gods boſome; whom now hee hopes hee may haue leaue to call Father, though (alacke) hee haue been too too vngracious a child. Thus he proceeds to arraigne and accuſe himſelfe; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging (for which hee hates himſelfe, becauſe it is ſo plaine that he cannot but know it), that he hath ſinned in ſuch and ſuch, and ſuch and ſuch particulars; and that he hath a moſt filthy heart, as full of wicked inclinations and thoughts, he thinkes verily, as the ſea it ſelfe is full of water. Wherefore hee paſſeth a very ſharpe ſentence vpon himſelfe, and that alſo very ſharpely; plainly ſaying, with an inward aſſenting of his very ſoule, that hee is fully worthy of all thoſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3455:22"/> plagues and puniſhments, which the Lord hath threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened in his word, and will execute in hell; and that it ſhould not be in the leaſt degree iniurious, if God would not be mercifull vnto him: for ah! how vnfit is he to receiue mercy? But yet withall, he takes heart in the moſt humble abaſement of himſelfe, moſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to call, and cry, and beg for mercy, and forgiueneſſe, and for the worke of grace, to change his nature from that loathſome diſpoſition which troubles him: now it may be, by the working of hope, hauing his heart ſo much ſoftened, that teares (before ſtopped vp by that binding force, that ſtrong and ſecret ſorrowes ſhew themſelues to haue in mans heart) doe euen begin to flow forth from him, to adde (if it might bee) a greater feruor vnto his prayers. And if at firſt, ſecond, third, fourth, and (it may be) many more times, he ſeeme to haue cried in vaine; becauſe none anſwere commeth, but heauen it ſelfe ſeemes ſtrongly ſtopped vp againſt him: yet hee goes againe ſtill to the ſame throne of grace, againe reckoning vp the ſame, and (if he can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo) new ſinnes, againe bewailing them bitterly, and heartily imploring both pardon and help againe. This is to come vnto Chriſt Ieſus heauie laden, as our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our comfortably inuiteth vs; this is to ſeeke God while hee may bee found, and to call vpon him while hee is neere, as the Prophet exhorteth vs. Which hauing done, he knowes not what to doe more; and therefore euen caſts himſelfe vpon Gods goodneſſe through Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; and knowing that in him (the Son) the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is well pleaſed, he ſtriues to reſt in him, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to knocke, continuing to ſeeke, becauſe his heart giues him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at laſt he ſhal not faile to find acceptance. And this ſpirit of prayer ſeemeth to me ſo proper to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:3455:22"/> the regenerate, that it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not any way befal the vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate: who when he feeleth not his miſery, doth but multiply idle words in ſeeming to pray, when he fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it is ſo wholly drowned and ſwallowed vp there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that he cannot runne vnto heauen for helpe. But with the regenerate, prayers and ſupplications are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies found, and a continuing therein alſo, how many bitter repulſes ſoeuer he ſuffers at Gods hand; as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten he doth very many, the Lord either deferring or making more ſpeed to anſwere, as hee ſees moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofefull for the profit of each of his ſeruants; and proportioning the fruit of his grace this way, to his knowledge of their ability and fitneſſe to receiue an anſwere, or to brooke delayes. It muſt not be denied, but that the man that neuer ſhall be regenerate (in the griping and twinges of his accuſing conſcience, through the working of the law, and the bare illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the ſpirit) may come ſo farre, as to roare out his <hi>Lord haue mercy vpon me,</hi> very often: yea, hee may by perſwaſion and entreatie of friends, be brought to reade ſome good prayers out of a prayer-booke: yea, to be glad to haue an other pray for him, in his owne hearing; and in ſome ſenſe alſo, to ioyne with him: yea more, by frequent perſwading, vrging, teaching of ſome godly man, he may be drawne to pray for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; but yet ſtill the ſpirit of prayer is abſent, in that he doth not finde himſelfe by an inward moouing of his owne heart) inclined (in the middeſt of his griefes and feares) to betake himſelfe (to God for helpe, by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon his name. And (which is a maine obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this matter) if he pray, he prayes almoſt altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for pardon, and for fauour, little for grace and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe; whereas the Chriſtian man, (by a ſecret draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3455:23"/> of his own inward ſoule, wrought by this regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſpirit) comes vnto the Lord with his requeſts, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging grace and holines, with no leſſe earneſtneſſe, then remiſſion and ſaluation. Yea, and hauing once begun this courſe, he finds ſo much refreſhing thereby, that he cannot but continue to doe it, euen ſometimes with much ſtrugling againſt, of his own hart, through feares and doubtings thereof. So it is one thing to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to pray by men, and to doe it for eaſe ſake; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to be inclined vnto it, by the priuate and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret working of the Spirit. One thing to beg for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, not much minding amendment; another thing to crie for the helpe of God to reforme ones heart and ſoule, as well as his free fauour to pardon former offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. An vnſanctified man, by benefit of Chriſtian ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, in long and heauie terrours, may come to the one of theſe; to the other, alone the Spirit of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication can leade one.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3455:23"/> time, no more queſtion of it then whither he liues yea, or no. From which aſſurance of ſpirit (hauing taſted the ſweetneſſe of Gods Grace, and felt how good the conſolations of his Word and Spirit are) he growes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in his very ſoule, for the time to come, in all things, to pleaſe God, and finds a new kind of diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, inabling him to auoide euill, and doe good; ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing put his necke vnder the gentle and eaſie yoke of Chriſt Ieſus, hee finds reſt vnto his ſoule: and thus is Chriſt formed in him, and he transformed into a new creature. For this firme purpoſe of will to pleaſe God in all things, is ſo manifeſt, and euident, and ſenſible a worke of grace; that now we may ſay, this act of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is growne to ſome good ripeneſſe, and euen now perfected in him: before he was in making a new man; but now he is made new: now he is begotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and become a ſonne of God, and heire of his kingdome, and fellow-heire of Chriſt. I know that it may befall an hypocrite (lying vnder the burthen of a terrified conſcience, which may be totally and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſeparated from regeneration, and regeneration from it) by the diligent inculcating of the comforts of the Goſpell, and the earneſt labour of ſome Chriſtian and godly men (that in ſuch caſe would faine ſpeake peace), to bee brought (becauſe they are told, there is none other way of comfort) to a purpoſe of neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſuch and ſuch groſſe ſinnes, as they are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of in their owne ſoules; and to ſome promiſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life: but this is rather a reſolution forced vpon them by ſtriuing of others, hereupon promiſing comfort; then a thing growing in themſelues, out of the ſenſe of the louing kindneſſe of the Lord their God. Whereas a Chriſtian finds ſomewhat within
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3455:24"/> him, inclining him, and making him to ſay within himſelfe, and euen little leſſe then to ſweare and vow with <hi>Dauid,</hi> that hee will ſurely keepe the righteous iudgements of the Lord, and that in all things, and for euer, to his dying day. And thus is the worke of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brought to ſome perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thus doth the holy Ghoſt mould the ſoule of a man into a new faſhion; thus doth hee ſtampe vpon him a new image, and as you would ſay, the very lineaments and proportion of God his Father, whom in a ſweete likeneſſe (that makes him amiable to God and Angels), he begins to reſemble. Onely my brethren vnderſtand you one thing for the better conceiuing of all that hath been ſpoken. There are two ſorts of regenerate men in the world. Some it pleaſeth God to call to himſelfe, euen very betimes, dropping pietie and grace into them, almoſt together with their mothers milke (by benefit of that great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God, holy and Chriſtian education), and that euen in certaine inſenſible degrees; ſo that they cannot ſo eaſily name the beginning and progreſſion of this worke. In theſe all the forenamed things are moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly found (for in truth the working of them doth not ceaſe, till life ceaſe); and that ſo, as ſometimes the one of theſe workes of grace is more ſtrong then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Sometimes they find a more ſenſible abaſement of themſelues within their owne hearts, out of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of their ſinfulneſſe; ſometimes deſires and prayers are more vehement; ſometimes a comfortable reſolution of pleaſing God, doth more mightily ſtirre in them: yet becauſe of the early working, and that they were wrought in a ſtill manner by very ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, the worke did almoſt goe beyond obſeruation; and they cannot ſo diſtinctly tell when they began to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3455:24"/> be abaſed, when to be raiſed vp. But there is another ſort of men regenerate, who did liue a long time in vnregeneracie; yea perhaps alſo in profanenes, and notable and notorious wickedneſſe, (for oft it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out that the Phariſies and Scribes make leſſe haſte to the kingdome of heauen, then the Publicans and ſinners, I meane that the groſſe offenders are ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner regenerated then the ciuill liuers). Now for ſuch men, it pleaſeth the holy Ghoſt many times, yea moſt times, to worke theſe foure fore-rehearſed workes, very diſtinctly; making as it were ſome euident pauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt each of them, and grace goes forward in them, euen ſtep after ſtep, in the manner that hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. Moſt times, if not alwaies, (the difference of their former life, when they were but dead, making the matter euident enough), they can name, when, and where, and by what meanes, the Lord began firſt to lay them low, to pull them downe; and (as they ſay, in nature corruption and generation goe together) to kil their old man by terrors; till being ſo ſlaine, he had in a calmer manner ſhewed them the filthineſſe and loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe of it. They can tell, what longings they felt before they durſt pray; and what adoe they had to bring themſelues to pray; and then, how long they continued praying, before they were anſwered; and laſtly, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſweet tidings came, that rauiſhed their ſoule with ioy, and made them ſo inamoured of Gods goodneſſe, that they euen made a ſtrong couenant with him, to walke in his waies and keepe his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. All theſe things (I ſay) they can tell well, and nothing doth them more good, then to recount with themſelues, this mightie act of the moſt high; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their foules (with as great a miracle as once <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:3455:25"/> his body) were raiſed vp from the rotten graue of ſinne, wherein they lay (wrapt vp in the winding ſheet of hardneſſe of heart, and blindneſſe of mind) ſtinking and putrifying; &amp; (as a carcaſſe crawleth with wormes) ſwarming with thoſe noyſome luſts, that are able to poyſon vp an honeſt heart.</p>

                     <hi>3.</hi> The effects of regeneration, which are foure.</note> Now I will declare vnto you (that which is the third thing I promiſed) the effects that follow hereupon. Not euery particular, (for who can name them? the life of grace abounding in multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of actions and operations, (as it were eating, drinking, breathing, grieuing, ſtriuing, ſmarting of the ſoule) as the life of nature); but alone ſome principall, and moſt eminent; by the ſeeing of which in it ſelfe, the ſoule of the new borne babe of Chriſt ſhall haue cauſe to receiue much comfort. The principall effects therefore of regeneration are theſe foure. Firſt, a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall combat. Secondly, a good life for all this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. Thirdly, a knowledge of that good eſtate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into the regenerate is tranſlated. Fourthly, Spirituall growth in thoſe graces, that at firſt were but weake
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3455:25"/> and feeble in the regenerate. For alack, an infant is a very tender thing, and ſo are Gods infants.</p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> The ſpirituall combat with</note> No ſooner doth a Chriſtian begin to draw the breath of this new life, but he findes himſelfe called to fighting euen in the very cradle (as I may ſo ſpeake, and as they fabled of that renowned heathen man). He ſtands in a pitched field of enemies, ſo ſoone as he can goe vpon the feete of his ſoule; and there hee muſt neuer ceaſe giuing and taking blowes, till hee ceaſe to be in this lower world. Although in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there be ſome intermiſſion, and relaxation of the ſtrength and furie of the encounter, as it pleaſeth the Lord (that knowes all things) to temper them to his ſtrength, and direct them to his good.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> The Diuell.</note> Firſt the diuell begins to play his part with him; and finding him gained out of his hands, and pulled from vnder his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, muſters vp an armie of tentations, wherewith at leaſt to annoy him; if hee cannot (as hee cannot) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile to bring him backe againe to his ſeruitude and thraldome. For when the ſtrong man armed kept his houſe, all things were at quiet vnder him: but when he feeles himſelfe bound, and caſt out, and his houſe rifled by a ſtronger then himſelfe, then it muſt needs follow, that hee will beſtirre himſelfe, and lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him with all the power that he can make. So now the poore Chriſtian (though perhaps but an infant in grace) is violently aſſailed by Satan, (according to his nature) with extreame rage and ſubtiltie. And if it haue ſo falne out, that the Spirit of God was faine to batter downe the height of his heart, and make paſſage for himſelfe, with horrible feares and terrors; then Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan labours often to reuiue thoſe terrors, and by infinit cauils and obiections, to make him euen deſpaire of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3455:26"/> his ſaluation. There is none end almoſt of the diuels ſtriuing in this caſe, but hee will labour continually with new doubts and obiections, to call his ſaluation into queſtion; and to make him thinke, that hee ſhall neuer enioy the quiet poſſeſſion of his heauenly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance. Yet againſt all theſe, the Spirit of God ſo ſtrengthens him, that by vertue of the gratious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, and by the power of conſtant prayers and ſupplications, he ſupports himſelfe, and ſtill continues to reſt himſelfe vpon the free goodneſſe of God in Chriſt, notwithſtanding all theſe obiections and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings. Neither yet will Satan reſt here, but is further troubleſome vnto him, by ſtirring vp innumerable vile ſuggeſtions, to draw him to the committing of ſome moſt notorious ſinnes, perhaps worſe then euer in all his life before; and for his old corruptions, he ceaſeth not to prouoke and incenſe them, with all vehemency, that he may driue him into lewd and hatefull practiſes of ſinne. But againſt theſe ſuggeſtions alſo, he fighteth reſolutely, much indeede vexed and diſquieted with them, but ſtill reiecting &amp; abhorring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and beating them back by the word of God (which is his ſword), &amp; by conſtant ſupplications; whereby ſtill he ſettles his ſoule firme and faſt in his holy purpoſes of obedience. I confeſſe, that the diuell is a common enemie to all mankinde, both ſanctified and vnſanctified: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the vnregenerate alſo are much moleſted with him oftentimes, when hee growes exorbitant, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to pull them (by the ſtrength of vtter deſpaire), as it were quicke into hell, and to make them kill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, or doe ſome other moſt groſſe and vnnaturall crime. But Satan is not willing to deale ſo roughly with them, if he could chuſe; for he ſtands euer in moſt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3455:26"/> danger of loſing them, when hee carries himſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, in ſo hard a faſhion. Wherefore he rather flatters, and faunes, endeuouring to rocke them aſleepe ſtill, if hee can, in the cradle of ſecuritie and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Neither will he ſtorme thus, but when he ſees his aduantage in regard of ſome bodily croſſe or diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; or that he ſees the Lord will needes awaken their ſleepie conſciences. But for the poore Chriſtian, hee would not giue him reſt, no not for a day or two, from the moſt horrible feares, and from the fouleſt tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereto his corruption giues any paſſage, or from others more hideous; eſpecially if hee ſee him weake, ſcrupulous, and iniudicious, then hee makes vſe of ſuch ignorance and weakneſſe; and will neuer finde time to make an end of vexing him, but that the Lord himſelfe doth pleaſe to ſound a retraite. Indeede the Lord, by this meanes to keepe downe his pride, and ouer-maſter his ſtrong corruptions, doth giue much way to Satans rage: but ſo ſtill, that he forgets not to refreſh him, with ſeaſonable aide of his ſpirit of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, and with the ſtrength and comfort of his holie word and promiſes. And in theſe termes ſtands hee with Satan, euer (almoſt) aſſailed and incumbred by him. And beſides this, the fleſh alſo,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>2.</hi> Of the fleſh.</note> as a more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous enemie, though not ſo violent, ſteps foorth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter him. For though by grace it be wounded and mortified, yet is it not quite and cleane taken away and remoued. Wherefore the corruptions of his heart alſo grow violent in him, luſting againſt the ſpirit, and with a kinde of inſinuating and ſecret inclination, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying him forward to all the former luſts of his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and perhaps to ſome that are more loathſome and abominable. Now vnbeliefe, paſſion, luſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:3455:27"/> wantonnes, worldlines, and all the old diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, will be mouing in his ſoule: and hee ſhall finde himſelfe euer and anon, little leſſe then ready to yeeld vnto them, and to be quite ouercome by them. But the ſpirit, in this caſe, reuiueth it ſelfe alſo, and luſts againſt the fleſh; ſtirring vp good motions againſt the bad, and holy deſires againſt the vnholy, and vertuous wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes againſt the vitious, and heartie prayers and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts to God againſt the ſinfull inclinations of the euill heart: ſo that at length his godly purpoſes grow ſtrong, and hee remaineth reſolute, not to worke wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, for all his earneſt proneneſſe thereunto. Thus the regenerate findes himſelfe ſtrangely diuided with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and againſt himſelfe: Sometimes hee would be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and commit ſuch and ſuch wickednes; and yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, hauing better thought of the matter, hee would not. At other times hee would caſt away all ſinne, and faine performe all good duties with all conſtancie: but hee findes ſomething within, reſiſting and rebelling, and hee would not be ſo good. But ſtill in concluſion either ſooner or later, the ſanctified part gets the better of the vnſanctified; the deſires and purpoſes of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, preuaile againſt the deſires and purpoſes of euil; and hee is ſetled in the holy determinations, that the ſpirit of God doth leade him vnto. His heart is euen a pitcht field of contrary deſires; the bad often grow very ſtrong and vehement, and able almoſt to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and chaſe away the good. But the good gather head againe, and beate backe the bad; and by the ſpirit hee mortifies the fleſh, and by the word of God and prayer ſubdueth and crucifies thoſe carnall affections of his. I confeſſe there is a miſerable ſtirre, &amp; a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome diſcord, in the ſoule of an vnſanctified man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:3455:27"/> the light of the conſcience, and the corruption of the will; this haling him forward to diuers wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and that drawing backe: but the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the naturall combat, and the ſpirituall, is ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that no good man, which hath felt them both, can chuſe but ſee how to diſtinguiſh them one from the other.<note place="margin">The d fference betwixt the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat of the fl ſh and ſpirit, and the oppoſition of the conſcience &amp; the corrupted will, in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate.</note> Indeed they are euidently diſtinguiſhed in fiue things: 1. In the faculties that oppoſe each other. 2. In the things about which they quarrell. 3. In the motiues of the oppoſition. 4. In the meanes of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. And fifthly, in the iſſue thereof. Firſt, in the vnregenerate the will is wholly carried after ſin, alone the conſcience makes a clamorous gainſaying, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers not the will to goe on in its euill courſes vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled. He would with all his heart commit wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but hee dares not: not ſo the regenerate. In him not the conſcience alone ſtands out againſt ſinne, but the will it ſelfe is diuided, in part hanging one way, in part another. Hee would not doe euill, not alone hee dares not; and the act of the will ſetting againſt its owne corruption, by its owne holineſſe, is farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the act of the conſcience, oppoſing the will that remaineth wholly corrupted. See it in a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: An hungry dogge hath a ſtrong appetite to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring ſome meate that ſtands before him: but at the ſame time he ſees a man ſtanding by with a cudgel to ſtrike him if he touch it. Now his appetite is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the meate, but he is feared and ouer-awed by the ſight of the man that is ready to ſtrike him. So is it with the vnſanctified man, ſinne is his foode, his will is wholly carried to it; but the conſcience holds as it were a cudgell ouer him, threatning to ſtrike, if he taſte. Wherefore, what with a full deſire he would do, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beareth
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:3455:28"/> in act to performe, affrighted by thoſe cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. But now a man diſeaſed, ſees ſome foode to which his appetite inclineth: but he knowes it hurtfull for his body, and therefore, though his will, drawne by his ſenſes, ſometimes moue him to be taſting; yet the ſame will, informed by reaſon, doth preuaile in him to be vnwilling, and out of ſuch vnwillingnes to forbeare. So is it with the godly man: His will ſtands to ſinne, for the pleaſure or profits ſake in ſome part: but being better taught by Gods ſpirit, of the ſinfulnes thereof, his owne will checks it ſelfe, and hee ſets vp his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to meddle with it. So is this point of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence made plaine; not to be willing to doe is another thing, then not to dare. In the former the will bridleth and holdeth-vnder its owne inward motions, and not alone the outward act: in the latter the motions of the will haue a free ſcope, but alone the outward act is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained. Further, in the things whereabout the ſtirre is, they differ very much. For the conſcience of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified, makes reſiſtance to their will, alone (vnleſſe in caſe they be vnder terrors of conſcience) in ſome more groſſe, notorious, palpable, and vnaccuſtomed ſinnes; which are commonly ioyned with ſhame and reproch in the world, and are not likely committed but by thoſe that are infamous amongſt men: as in periurie, murther, adulterie, theft, falſe witneſſe bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and ſuch like. For ſmaller euils, and ſuch as the world little accounts of, though knowne and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be ſinnes, the naturall conſcience is content to diſpenſe, and dawbe, and daily, and giue eaſie way to the doing of them, vpon a thouſand fond ſhifts and pretences: but now the regenerate mans wil (ſo far as it is regenerate) is in combat againſt its owne vnſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiednes,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:3455:28"/> about euery knowne euill, the little as well as the great; that that is allowed in the common practiſe of the world, as well as that that is diſallowed. For of him it is truly ſaid, that hee worketh none iniquitie. Thirdly, the naturall conſcience vſeth the motiues (or reſtraints rather) of feare, of ſhame, of danger amongſt men, at the beſt and moſt, of deſtruction and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God: and by threatning theſe things, (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſomewhat terribly) it ouer-aweth the motions of the will, from conſenting to act, though not to deſire. But in the regenerate will, the arguments of reſiſtance are fetcht from God, and from Chriſt, from the loue of God, from the death of Chriſt, from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſcandall of religion, from the diſhonour of the name of God, from the Lords being diſpleaſed with ſinne; and not onely, barely, or chiefly, from the puniſhment of ſinne. Fourthly, the conſcience of the vnſanctified driues him not to prayer, to the word, to ſpirituall medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as weapons, whereby to mortifie euill luſts, and to reſtraine the will from conſenting; only it followes him with its owne vehement checks and reluctations, in diuers troubleſome and confuſed thoughts. But the ſanctification of the will oppoſeth its corruption, by prayers, by the word, by the blood of Chriſt Ieſus, and by the hopes of eternitie. For hauing this hope, hee purgeth himſelfe as Chriſt is pure. So the vnſanctified man, when he would doe euill and dares not, is toſſed and tumbled from place to place, now thinking of one thing, now of another, wiſhing to follow his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, but wanting boldneſſe; and if hee doe any thing to help himſelfe, it is to get him into ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that perhaps may eaſe him a while. But the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, when he findes this diſtraction of his will, vſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3455:29"/> ſeekes out ſome ſecret place; tels himſelfe of Gods commandement, of Gods loue, of Chriſts ſuffering for him; asketh himſelfe, if he can finde in his heart ſo much to offend ſo good a Father, ſo perfect a Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: and then falling downe, telleth the Lord how wicked he findes himſelfe, what foule deſires are ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in him, and how weake he is to make reſiſtance; he beſeecheth God to pull out this pricke of his fleſh, to ſtrengthen him againſt theſe wicked deſires, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh his heart in a ſincere purpoſe of obedience, by his holy ſpirit, and ſo riſeth vp confirmed. Thus (I ſay) he doth vſually and ordinarily, though ſometimes the ſuddenne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> of occaſions hinders him that he cannot; and ſometimes his owne neglect of dutie hath ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranged him, that he findes no power ſo to doe: in which laſt caſe he is often foyled, in the former not ſo often. Laſtly, the conſcience, if it take the foyle once or twice, is benumbed and ſilenced. Sometimes it ſuffers its mouth to be cleane ſtopped, by ſome idle ſhift and vaine diſtinction, which the wit (that in many men is too good for their conſcience) hath inuented for the iuſtification of euill: and after ſome ſuch paultry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence or apologie, a man is ſuffered to ſinne freely enough. But if the thing be neuer ſo vniuſtifiable, yet after two or three times doing it, the heart is harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the naturall conſcience put to ſilence; and a mans checkes grow faint, or none at all, vntill ſome croſſe come, or ſome immediate hand of God to ſet it on working againe. For why? the vnſanctified man, as he did not beg grace to hold him vp before his ſinne; ſo neither after, hath any heart to goe and confeſſe it, and craue the ſpirit of repentance; but either lets it paſſe, or falles to extenuate and excuſe it, vnleſſe (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps)
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3455:29"/> it grow deſperate, as in <hi>Iudas.</hi> But now the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the will, doth ſtill get the victory, though it may receiue a foyle. It will not bee put downe; it will not be vanquiſhed: yea euery latter time of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, it is more vehement in its oppoſition then before: at leaſt ſo farre as to make a man appeare more vile and abominable to himſelfe. So it brings him into Gods preſence againe, ſooner or later; and makes him ſay, Lord I haue done exceeding fooliſhly! but ah, doe away the ſinne of thy ſeruant, for thy Sonnes ſake; and Lord through thy grace helpe me, that hereafter I may offend no more. Thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly he doth quickly renue his repentance, and the ſpirit wins the field of the fleſh; though it were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſaduantaged, and made to recoyle backe at firſt. For ſtronger is the ſpirit that is in vs, then that, that is in the world: grace is alwaies in concluſion more auailable then naturall corruption. Yea, when Gods children are moſt deeply caſt (through preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinning) into the ſownes of deadneſſe, ſecurity, and vnconſcionableneſſe; yet then ſtill they heare a voyce behind them ſaying, This is the way, walke in it. Then the ſanctification of the will ſhewes it ſelfe, in many motions and riſings againſt the euils that they doe, and by renewing in them the purpoſes of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; though theſe purpoſes, perhaps (in caſe of great preuailing of corruption) be ſo weake and feeble, that they be not put in practice, any thing thoroughly, till God ariſe to weaken corruption, and to ſtrengthen grace: and then he weepes, and prayes, and recouers himſelfe, reſoluing to ſinne ſo no more, and ſtanding to his reſolutions. And ſo fareth a poore Chriſtian within himſelfe. There is a ciuill warre in his very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3455:30"/> and his bowels be ſomtimes little leſſe then rent aſunder with inteſtine diſcord, betwixt himſelfe, and himſelfe. Hee is no longer one, but two men, the old, and the new; deadly enemies, dwelling both in one roome. He findes two lawes in his heart, the law of his fleſh, and the law of the ſpirit; that drawing him cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to ſinne, and this helping him out of that captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. He ſerues God in one part of his will, and ſinne in the other; not meaning this laſt of ſuch a ſeruing of ſinne as was before his new birth, but ſome kind of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, euen a doing of that ſometimes that ſinne doth perſwade, though vnwillingly and againſt the haire. Neither yet is this all; for as within hee is thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>3.</hi> The world.</note> ſo can he not long be free from diſquietment without. The third enemy ſtands vp quickly, and that is the world; and that hates him, malignes him, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors him, cannot away with him. When once ſome glimpſe of Gods image ſhineth in him, then worldly men perceiuing it, if they were his friends, turne foes. They thinke and call him a foole; they ſay he is either proud, or ſtout, or mad, or all. After a while alſo come ſlanders, as it were ſtronger and ſharper weapons: then (if the times will giue leaue) his enemies grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in rage, as he growes in goodneſſe, hee meetes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with loſſe of goods, baniſhment, and euen death it ſelfe. So the world tries, what ſhe can doe by violence, if that way ſeeme the fitteſt courſe of pulling him backe againe into her ſociety: but if the caſe bee ſuch, that that way ſeeme not at firſt ſo plauſible, the world aſſaults him with ſtrong allurements; his friends and neighbours will perſwade him to returne to bee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againe: he ſhall haue large offers of friendſhip, and of gaine. Many entreaties, many promiſes, many
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3455:30"/> aſſurances, and many performances of good turnes, as ſtrong baits, are held out before him, to diuert him from the wayes of godlineſſe. And theſe fairer aſſaults often hurt him much more, then the more violent; but yet ſtill his faith is his victory, by which he ouercomes the world. The aſſurance that he findes in himſelfe of Gods eternall loue, and the ſweet effects therof makes him to diſdaine theſe ſugred allurements, and to ſtand ſtrong againſt thoſe bitter encounters; flatter they, or frowne they; doe him good, or doe him euill, ſtill hee holds himſelfe to this concluſion, hee will not leaue God, to cleaue vnto the world againe. Thus you ſee how the regenerate man is laid too, on euery hand, within, without, on euery ſide. There is no day in a yeere, no houre in a day; nay verily, ſcarce any minute in an houre, wherein ſome one or other of theſe his backe friends, doth not ſtriue to doe him a ſpight. The worſt enemie is within himſelfe, the next is the diuell, and the world the leaſt. Theſe welcome him in this manner, into the City of God. Thus they entertaine him into the ſociety of Chriſts myſticall body. But in all theſe things he is an excellent conquerour, yea ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily more then a conquerour, through him that hath loued him: for he is out of all danger, of euer being quite ouercome. Wherefore notwithſtanding all the trouble of this firſt effect of grace;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>2.</hi> A good life.</note> the ſecond will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the firſt, and that is, a good conuerſation. A man would imagine, that the forenamed incumbrances ſhould ſo farre diſcourage his heart, to whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell; as to take from him all boldneſſe, ſo much as to attempt a good courſe. And indeed ſo it would, were he not continually led and ſtrengthened by the ſame ſpirit, that at firſt regenerated him. But by vertue of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3455:31"/> that diuine aſſiſtance, it comes to paſſe quite contrary: for thoſe enemies doe but quicken and further his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in goodneſſe; and in ſpight of them all, let earth and hell and his owne heart, doe the worſt that euer they can, hee is able to liue godly in Chriſt Ieſus. He is inabled both to leaue euill, and to doe good (for both theſe parts of a good life muſt be had, or elſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the life is not good); and that in a good meaſure and quantitie, and farre better then euer he could doe, in former times. Indeed he doth neuer ſatisfie himſelfe in this matter, but alwaies falleth farre ſhorter then his owne deſires aſpire vnto: but were the former luſts of his ignorance, compared to that his preſent beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, a blinde man might perceiue the difference to be exceeding great. For as to the firſt part of a good life, which ſtands in leauing off wickedneſſe, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſo farre; not, as to be quite free from all ſinne (ah this life were a little heauen vnto him, if he could once attaine to ſuch freedom); but indeed he cannot attaine it here, for in many things (ah that word many is too true a word), I ſay in many things we ſin all; and they be quite beſides their Chriſtian wits, that imagine once repenting, to be ſufficient for a Chriſtian man, in all his life: but yet ſo farre hee comes, as to forſake the ordinary practiſe of groſſe ſins, and the allowance of all knowne and vehemently ſuſpected ſins. So ſoone as euer a Chriſtian is truly regenerate, ſo ſoone he ceaſeth to make a trade of ſinning. Hee that is borne of God ſinneth not, neither can ſin, in this manner. He may ſlip into faults of groſſe nature, once, twice, many times, (ſin cleauing ſo faſt vnto him as it doth), but ſtill it is not his vſuall practiſe ſo to tranſgreſſe. For in truth, now ſin is become vnnaturall to him, and as contrarie
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3455:31"/> to the life of grace beſtowed vpon him, as poyſon is contrary to his naturall life; and as bitter things are to his taſte, and harſh ſounds vnto his eare: wherefore his ſoule riſeth againſt it, and he doth much more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ouercome the tentations by reſiſtance, then is ouercome of them. Sins, I meane groſſe and grieuous ſins, are to him as deadly wounds to his body; which ſometimes (as a man in a frenzie) hee is drawne to giue himſelfe, but vſually hee doth not ſo. And when hee doth ſo, the manner is exceedingly different from his former courſe. Then hee committed it with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe: now with great and continuall reluctation. Then hee kept in himſelfe a purpoſe of ſinning, if he could for feare of ſhame or danger: now his heart ſtands conſtantly reſolute not to ſinne. Then he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after the occaſions of ſinning: now hee flyes farre from them. Then hee ſhifted, and excuſed himſelfe, hauing committed ſinne: now hee becomes a moſt bitter and ſeuere cenſurer of himſelfe for ſinne, if hee doe commit it. Hauing falne, he riſeth againe, and with anger indites and arraignes himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords tribunall. There hee poureth foorth many bitter lamentations, and could almoſt finde in his heart to throw himſelfe downe to very hell for it. He thunders out againſt his owne heart, all the bitter curſes and threatnings of the Law; and is euen almoſt willing, that God ſhould euen damne him for it, but that he hopeth, for his mercie ſake, hee will not ſo doe. And ſuch is his freedome from groſſe ſinnes, that are againſt the plaine light of nature, or expreſſe words of the Law, and wherein the members of the body are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as weapons of vnrighteouſnes. He falls into them, if at all, yet ſeldome, and ſeldomer and ſeldomer, with
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3455:32"/> an horrible ſtrife, with great anxietie, with little or no content; and with a moſt vehement condemning of himſelfe, before the face of God, in ſecret, afterwards. Thus vnleſſe (perhaps) hee bee caſt into a ſowne for a time, and cannot yet riſe againe: which if hee be, hee fares all that while as a man that hath a thorne in his eye, or wound in his ſides, neuer at reſt, neuer quiet, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with bitter and intollerable anguiſh, and full of wofull and continuall complaints. For ſtill he heareth the voyce behinde him ſounding in his cares, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this is not the way. And ſtill the anoynting that he hath receiued doth ſo preſerue him, that he cannot ſinne, meaning, giue himſelfe ouer to a ſetled reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or practiſe of ſinne. And yet further, for ſinnes of a leſſe grieuous nature, euill motions, ſudden paſſions, dulneſſe and diſtractions in good things, and the like: God knowes, and he knowes, that he commits full ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them. But alwaies hee is ſo vpright with God, that hee allowes them not. Hee doth not extenuate them, he doth not ſhift them off with a piſh; hee doth not runne ouer them as matters of nothing, hee doth not let them paſſe vnobſerued and vnregarded, as in former time, and as it is with vnſanctified men. But they be vnto him matter of conſtant and daily ſorrow and ſhame and humiliation. He confeſſeth them dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he prayes againſt them daily, and he is continually in a quarrell with himſelfe, becauſe he cannot be ſo free from them as he deſireth. So it comes to paſſe that he purgeth himſelfe as Chriſt is pure, ſo farre preuailing againſt theſe ſinnes, that hee commits fewer of them, and commits them ſeldomer, &amp; ſees them with more diſlike of himſelfe, and growes by them more meane and baſe in his owne eyes, and is made by them more
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3455:32"/> carefull to ſue vnto the Lord Ieſus, and to take more ſtedfaſt hold of his merits. So hee caſteth off the old man, as concerning the conuerſation in time paſt, and that euen out of his new nature; not moued thereto by reward, or puniſhment; either alone or principally, but by a kinde of naturall working of grace in him: but (indeed) it is a ſupernaturall nature poured into him from aboue; by which it comes to paſſe, that as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, he cannot ſinne, he knowes not how to work wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, he cannot finde in his heart to be a ſlaue to ſinne any longer. Company or no company, ſeene of men or not ſeene, danger or no danger, ſhame or no ſhame, puniſhment or no puniſhment, ſtill he is auerſe from ſinne in his regenerate part; he wils not to doe it, he ſhunneth it, he bewaileth it, one or both: that ſo it may be manifeſtly ſeene, there is a contrariety betwixt his very ſoule and all ſins, that hee knoweth to be ſins. And for thoſe that are not knowne to him; hee is not ignorant of them, becauſe he will not know them, with neglect of the meanes of knowing, or with a wilfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of them: but alone becauſe he cannot know them, either for want of meanes to know, or capacitie to conceiue of, or light to ſee the truth offered. Hee doth not winke with his eyes, he doth not ſet himſelfe to finde out ſhifts, to bury the light that beginneth to appeare, and to hold downe the truth in vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; ſtriuing not to know ſinne, becauſe he would not leaue it, and out of a purpoſe to practiſe it, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or pleaſure of it; ſtill labouring to haue ſomewhat to ſay in its defence, and to elude and ſhift off whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer may be ſaid againſt it: but he is willing to know, deſirous and ready to yeeld, and when the light begins to ſhine within, he quickly opens his eyes to behold
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3455:33"/> the ſame; and if he ſuſpect it, he lookes more narrowly into it, with a ſincere purpoſe of being conuinced, if the truth appeare vnto him. And this is the firſt part of a good life. The ſecond, and as neceſſary as the firſt, is doing of good, wherein hee is carefull to exerciſe himſelfe; and though all be not alike fruitful, yet euery regenerate man is fruitfull in ſome degree. The life of grace hath its gratious effects, as well as the life of nature its naturall: and hee that hath the former, is as kindly and freely carried to the one, as he that hath the life of nature, to the other. By the ſupernaturall life of God that is in the ſanctified man, it is naturall to him, to ſpeake to God in prayer, to heare from God in the Word, to conferre with God in holy meditations. Wherefore theſe things hee findes himſelfe inwardly moued vnto, and hee cannot chuſe but be conſtant in them. If at any time his wicked fleſh hinder him from them (as ſickneſſe makes a man ſometimes that hee cannot eate his meate), then doth hee feele, as ſenſible a miſſe of them, euen as of his meales; and he could be as well without foode, as without theſe exerciſes: for in truth they are the foode of his ſoule, and he reliſheth them as foode, though ſometimes leſſe then at other times, as the diſeaſes of his ſoule grow more or leſſe within him. Further, mercie, iuſtice, liberalitie, truth, diligence, and other vertues, are now natural vnto him as well as religion. He takes comfort in doing the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof, and makes conſcience of doing them, as he hath occaſion. Indeed ſometimes he findes a great loathneſſe and backwardneſſe, as a man that is lame, limps and goes ſoftly and with paine; but yet he goes, and hee muſt needs goe, and for all the loathneſſe, hee cannot be well vnleſſe he addreſſe himſelfe vnto them.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3455:33"/> Often he hath little mind to pray, and doe other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious duties; but then alacke, he finds himſelfe (as wee ſay for the body) not well at caſe, and hee hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within him, that puts him forward, that preſſeth and vrgeth him, and cauſeth that he muſt doe them, though with much weaknes, and reſiſtance of his fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hart; for in part it is ſtil fleſhly. If he haue neglected a work of mercy, he is not wel after it, and he is inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grieued for it, and reſolues to take the opportunitie better next time. If he haue not followed his calling diligently, he is vexed at heart to thinke of it, and that day is a day of little comfort, that night a night of little reſt vnto him. So, if he haue omitted admonitions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, good conference, or any other part of good life. Not alone one, but all good duties, both of the firſt and ſecond Table, ſo farre as his knowledge exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, begin to bee to him naturall and familiar. Hee takes a ſecret and a ſweet delight in doing them, &amp; he finds himſelfe exceedingly diſcontented with himſelf, if he doe them not; and therefore commonly though he come farre ſhort of what he would and ſhould, yet there is no day without a line; ſome or other good worke he doth daily, herein indeede exceeding al that himſelfe was able to doe before, or that vnſanctified men can attaine to; that, what he doth, he doth it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God would haue him doe it; and his heart doth often actually incline it ſelfe to the will of God, and moue it ſelfe to the duties, with minding it ſelfe of the good pleaſure of God. It is not companie; it is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, nor credit, nor gaine, which ſweyes him; if all theſe things were away; yea, if all theſe things were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, yet he would doe good: for he knowes, that Gods wil is his guide, and that is the thing he deſireth
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3455:34"/> to accompliſh in his very ſoule. And further, though he be like a young Artificer, that vſeth his tooles ſomwhat vnskilfully, and doth his buſineſſe ſomewhat bungling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; yet the Scriptures, the Word of God, they bee his line and his leuell, and according to the direction, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpecial, or general, which he receiueth from them, he ſtriueth to frame his life and actions. So is the true Conuert godly in life; groſſe ſinnes vſually he commits not; the ſmalleſt knowne ſins he euer diſ-alloweth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth, confeſſeth before God in ſecret; and ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ſins he labors to know, and for feare auoideth; and vnknowne ſins he is ready and willing to know. Al and all maner of good duties (though ſome he finds more hard and difficult, and himſelfe more backward vnto them; yet I ſay, all, and all manner of good duties) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolueth to do, and ſtriueth to do; and either doth them, or is afterwards very angry with himſelf, for not hauing done them; ſo that his life is to his own feeling, but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry death, if he find it to haue bin vnprofitable: &amp; which is much to be marked, he is heartily glad to ſee, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers can do the good that he cannot, or can do it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then himſelf.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>3.</hi> Knowledge of this good eſtate.</note> So you haue the ſecond effect of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: the third followes, and that is a knowledge of this his good eſtate. The man regenerate, vnderſtands himſelf to be regenerate, as the man that liueth &amp; wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, that he liueth and walketh.

                  <hi>We know that we are tranſlated from death to life.</hi> Loe, I ſay, an aſſured word of knowing, vſed by the Apoſtle. But how knowes he it? euen by a moſt infallible know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, grounded vpon the perceiuing of the effects of a ſpiritual life: as hee knowes, that he is a liuing man, and not a carcaſſe, by feeling in himſelf the manifeſt effects of this common life. For in very truth, ſpirituall life can
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3455:34"/> no more be hidden, then naturall. Can that admirable change, that cumberſome combat, that ſo far from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times differing, life be found in a man, and he not know of it? Can a blind man become ſeeing, and he not know it? Can a deafe man heare, a lame man go, a ſicke man become whole, a dead man liue, and not know of theſe alterations in themſelues? It is vtterly impoſſible, that ſuch things ſhould be hidden from him in whom they be: &amp; the taking away of blindnes, deafenes, dumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, lamenes, death, from the ſoule, is to him in whom it is, no leſſe manifeſt and euident, then the remouing of theſe bodily infirmities. And therfore S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.13.</note> 
                  <hi>I write vnto you babes, becauſe you haue knowne the Father,</hi> meaning with a knowledge of acquaintance, whereby they conceiue him to be their father; ſuch as little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (to whom he alludeth) haue of their fathers and mothers that they be theirs. In truth the Chriſtian man finds in himſelfe, ſomething within him, ſealing him vp to life: he hath an earneſt penny that makes the bargain ſure betwixt the Lord and his ſoule. He cannot but call God Father, and often (though not alwaies) in calling him ſo, he euen feeles him ſo alſo. He hath an inward &amp; a ſure certificate of his reconciliation with his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord. And if doubts doe ariſe (as I told you before that they would, and that right often, and very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly: for the diuel wil caſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in, thick and threefold, and with great viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce), theſe his very doubtings driue him to his father to be reſolued of his doubts; by which meanes it comes to paſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as a truth is much cleared, by making &amp; anſwering obiections, ſo his aſſurance is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by theſe doubts. Indeed an infant at firſt, hath not ſo much knowledge, or vſe of reaſon, as to conceiue of his owne life: but when ſome daies are paſt, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3455:35"/> becomes ſtronger, then doth he wel enough know that he liueth: ſo in the infancy of regeneration, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate can ſcarce tell that he is regenerate, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a little growne forward in a good life, hee findeth his caſe plaine enough, and wants not this aſſurance, though he be incumbred with many doubtings. Yea, when hee ſtands at the weakeſt, and doth moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine for want of this aſſurance, yet euen at that time, he neither accounts it impoſſible, nor yet needleſſe to haue it; but deſireth it with the ſtrongeſt of his deſires, and is troubled for want of it, more then for want of any other thing: and the feeling that he hath it not, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth but to quicken his care of ſeeking it, and to make him ſeeke ſoundly, that he may not bee deceiued with falſe imaginations about it. Sometimes alſo it fals out, that a fit of Melacholy poſſeſſeth a growne man ſo ſtrongly, that hee imagines himſelfe no better then a dead man: but then the actions of life performed by him, do put the matter out of queſtion, amongſt others that haue life; and the ſame actions at laſt, perſwade himſelf alſo, that he liueth. Euen ſo a man borne again, and well growne in the life of Grace, through ſtrength of tentation, may bee ſo farre troubled, as to make a great doubt, whither he liue the life of grace yea or no. But he by feeling the troubleſomnes of this feare, &amp; by ſtriuing againſt it, at length doth euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly find, that he iudged falſely of his own caſe, and ſo returneth to enioy his aſſurance again. Yea, ſomtimes a liuing ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by ſome wound receiued, or by ſome inward diſtemperature, is caſt into a deadly ſwoune, neither feeling life, nor gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any great ſignes of it: but after a while, by rubbing and the like meanes, he is reſtored to the vſe, and to the feeling of life. So a regenerate man being ouercome
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:3455:35"/> by ſome tentation, and hauing runne into ſome ſown, doth lie almoſt like a man dead in ſinnes and treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; but after ſome checks of his owne heart, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions of others, and corrections from the Lord, he is reuiued out of that ſowne, and begins to ſhew forth the effects of grace; and withall, with comfort to feele and vnderſtand the ſame. Wherfore it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that the knowledge of a mans being regenerate, is a neceſſary effect of regeneration, and which faileth not, out of the forenamed caſes, and after ſome time to reueale it ſelfe. Hence it is, that the regenerate man wonders at no kind of men more, then at them which will needs hold, that the matter of ones being truly ſanctified is ſo extremely ambiguous, as that, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the deceitfulneſſe of mans heart, it ſhould bee impoſſible for any man, infallibly to know himſelfe to be in the ſtate of grace. He counts this is as abſurd, as if a man ſhould ſay, that becauſe an image may bee made and painted ſo like a liuing man, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, fits of melancholy, and ſownes are of ſo ſtrong a working in men; therefore it ſhould be impoſſible for any man to know vſually and infallibly, that himſelfe is a liuing man. Hee perceiues that ſuch men ſpeake thus, alone becauſe they talke of theſe points barely by roar (as they ſay) &amp; by meere ſpeculatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For he hauing known the powerful working of Gods ſpirit, knoweth well enough that he hath found it; and knowes that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it, it will make it ſelfe ſo euident, that after a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while it will be knowne; and when he wants it, hee findes himſelfe not driuen to denie the poſſibility or neceſſity of knowing it; but alone to bee grieued, and to condemne himſelfe that he doth not get that, which is both poſſible &amp; neceſſary to be gotten. He finds al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:3455:36"/> that though, after his committing of ſome kindes of ſinnes, this his aſſurance that hee is Gods childe, is very much enfeebled; yet there is a ſecret and ſtrong worke of grace, inwardly mouing him, inuiting him, leading him by the hand; and little leſſe then with a kind of ſweet and gentle violence, drawing him to go to God and confeſſe his ſinne, crauing mercy, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing amendment, and caſting himſelfe vpon Chriſt for acceptance: that now he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but ſay within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſure here is life, though before the matter were called into doubt. Yea he findeth the ſpirit of adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, dictating vnto him the name of Father, in this caſe, and making him bold ſo to call God, and to cry vnto him, till at length he perceiue by manifeſt ſignes, that hee is indeed a Father vnto him. Yea verily, to the Chriſtian man, this knowledge of God is ſo rich and precious a iewell, that he makes more account of it then of a thouſand worlds, and a thouſand liues. Wherefore of (almoſt) all errours concerning mans condition, hee can with leaſt patience brooke their (to him being made in caſe to diſcerne it) moſt palpable fancy, of which I ſpake before, that thinke it impoſſible to attaine a ſure knowledge and infallible, that one is the child of God, not know himſelfe to bee Gods by regeneration, and adoption. Take away his life then, take away his being. The world is worſe then a priſon and a dungeon to him, if the light of this knowledge bee taken away: hee can haue no quiet in himſelfe, no comfort in any thing elſe, without this knowledge; he perceiues that this is the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of his ſoule, in an holy life, that hee knowes himſelfe to be begotten againe by the ſeed of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, to a liuely hope, and to an immortall inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:3455:36"/> This knowledge therefore is ſo neceſſary vnto him, that hee cannot liue without it: and hence it is that he no longer enioyes himſelfe then he retaines it. And ſo much for the third effect of regeneration. The fourth, and (of thoſe that I purpoſe to ſpeake of) the laſt effect followeth. That is growth. As a naturall life,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>4.</hi> Growing in grace.</note> ſo likewiſe a ſpiritual, by degrees encreaſeth &amp; waxeth ſtronger &amp; ſtronger, approching neerer to perfection; &amp; that with a proportionable &amp; ſutable encreaſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery part and member, as I may call it, of the new man. For though in ſome parts he may be weaker then in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; yet in thoſe weaker parts alſo, conſidering the weakneſſe, there is a growth correſpondent to the growing of other parts.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.2.</note> All the branches that bring forth fruit in Chriſt the vine, the Father the good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman purgeth, that they may bring forth more fruit; and in Chriſt all the body hauing nouriſhment miniſtred, and knit together,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.19.</note> encreaſeth with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of God; and that alſo according to the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all working of euery part. A liuing branch, in a liuing tree, will draw ſap, and get growth. A liuing member, of a liuing body, cannot (by the courſe of nature) but attract fit nouriture, and procure to it ſelfe a going forward in ſtature, till the ſtature bee full and perfect. Doubtleſſe Chriſt is a liuing tree, his myſticall body a liuing body; wherefore the regenerate muſt needs be growing. But this matter of growth doth ſtand in need of a ſound explanation. Vnderſtand therefore that there is a double growth, one in greatneſſe, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in goodneſſe; one in quantity, the other in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. So you may ſee a man from his birth, to 24. or 25. yeeres grow bigger and bigger, he is higher and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, hath larger lims, and ſtronger ioynts; but from
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3455:37"/> theſe yeeres vpward he growes wiſer, ſager, more ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, more ſober and better ſetled alſo in his bodily might. So an apple from Spring to Midſommer or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, growes larger and larger in bigneſſe; from thence to the time of its pulling, it growes pleaſanter and pleaſanter in taſte, and better and better reliſhed. Thus it is with a Chriſtian man: For a good ſpace of time, hee doth ſenſibly encreaſe in knowing and leauing more ſinnes, and in knowing and doing more duties; this is to grow in bigneſſe: but after a good time ſpent in Chriſts ſchoole, and that there bee but few new leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (not aboue his forme, as it were) to be learnt, hee cons ouer the old leſſons againe, and gets them more perfectly by heart, and better vnderſtood. Thoſe ſins he leaueth, he leaueth with more ſincerity, with more rectified zeale, with more loue to God, with more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of ſinne. Thoſe duties likewiſe which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth, he performeth more aduiſedly, more reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, more humbly, more ſoundly, and with a more entire bending of his ſoule to the glory of God in them, then before: This is his growing in goodneſſe and in ripeneſſe. And alwaies in this latter kinde of growth a Chriſtian man ſtands ſo affected, that hee doth moſt of all quarrell with himſelfe for not grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when he growes moſt of all. Yea his ſlippes into ſome groſſe faults (and it may bee alſo ſometimes too too thicke) doe further this his growth ordinarily; ſo that he neuer growes faſter and better, then after the time that ſome falles have diſcouered vnto him his badneſſe: for then he growes in humility; in hatred of himſelfe, in ſuſpicion of his owne frailty, whereby he is made capable of a profitable growing in all vertues, till at length this become his excellency, that the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:3455:37"/> he is, the meaner he is in his owne eyes; and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he proceedeth, the more he is acquainted with his owne defects, and becomes more ſorrowfull and aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for the ſlowneſſe of his proceedings. But now it muſt be further conceiued, that this growth hath his ſtops, ſtayes, hindrances, intermiſſions; and thoſe alſo ſomtimes euen ſome long ſpace of time together, euen for moneths and yeeres, as is to be ſeene in <hi>Dauid, Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Aſa, Vzziah,</hi> and others. For as in naturall life, the child may grow till it be twentie, or more yeeres old, and then fall into a dangerous fit of ſickneſſe, as an ague, or the like; which ſhall caſt him vpon his bed, and make his cheekes pale and wan, his legges quaking and feeble, his ſtomacke naught, and quite turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from, almoſt all food, his whole body faint and powerleſſe; ſo that he can neither ſtand nor goe, nor ſcarce ſpeake or moue himſelfe, but euen lie at point of death: Euen ſo alſo in the life of grace there be Agues, there bee diſeaſes, there bee ſickneſſes, into which a Chriſtian man (euen now (it may be) come to ſo much ripenes, as this life wil beare) doth ſuddenly ſomtimes, but moſt times by degrees fall headlong, and almoſt dies, though quite to die it bee impoſſible. Now if you ſpeake of his growing, hee doth but grow back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; euen as a ſicke man growes weaker and weaker, after ſickneſſe hath ceized vpon him. Theſe diſeaſes grow for the moſt part from the comming in of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion and wealth, and the pleaſures and vanities that moſt commonly come in with them; that we may ſee how dangerous the goods and greatneſſe of this world be to a Chriſtian ſoule, that cannot ſoundly digeſt and concoct them. Or elſe, they ariſe from the poyſonfull infection of ſome euill companion or other, to whom a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3455:38"/> man hath by ſome occaſion fooliſhly linked himſelfe in familiaritie. In truth moſt times ſurfeting breeds ſpirituall ſickneſſe. From the exceſſiue loue, and liking, and vſing, and enioying of earthly things, and from a conceit of ones owne being better and ſafer for their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, a man comes to bee leſſe ſatisfied in God, and in holy duties; and to haue leſſe minde to thinke and muſe of heauen, and the graces of Gods Spirit, the practiſing of which is the way to come to heauen. So there is a ſtoppage and obſtruction in the ſoule, and hence ſo ſenſible a decay of ſpiritual ſtrength, til a man fall to heape more then one or two groſſe ſinnes (and ſometimes preſumptuous), one vpon the necke of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſometimes to lie long in them, before hee can ſee to reforme them, or ſoundly renew his repentance for them; the one hardning his heart, and blinding his minde ſo, that the other following can ſcarce be ſeene or felt. Thus there is wrought a ſtrange decay of the power of godlineſſe, euen in a true regenerate man, by the encreaſe of his outward eſtate: for he was a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied man,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 30.9.</note> that prayed God not to giue him riches, leſt himſelfe being full, ſhould denie God, and ſay, Who is the Lord? And ſometimes alſo on the contrarie, euen hard and ſharpe afflictions doe bring a decay of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. The anguiſh of a croſſe may breede impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie, diſtruſt, lying, vſing of baſe ſhifts, and twenty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders in a regenerate mans life; in ſo much, that hee may be drawne to very groſſe and ſinfull practiſes. But when the poore Chriſtian ſoule is either of theſe waies diſeaſed, or any other like to them; O, then he fareth like to a ſicke man indeed, he feeles his diſeaſe with exceeding great paine. It makes him groane, and crie out many a time, hee is weary, full weary of ſuch an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:3455:38"/> No man is more tyred with a burning fit of an ague, then he with theſe fits. Reſt, comfort, quiet he can get none. Indeed the diuell and the world in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, doe as friends vſe to doe in caſe of ſickneſſe. They bring likely conſerued Plums or Marmelade, or ſome ſuch like ſweete meate, which the poore ſicke man takes indeede, becauſe they will haue it ſo that are about him: but alas, they doe but clamme his mouth, and hee findes their very ſweetneſſe bitter and troubleſome: So the diuell and the world, and the fleſh, offer to the Chriſtian ſoule, the pleaſures, and profits of this world, as it were ſweet meats, &amp; he willing to find eaſe in any thing, ſeekes if there it may bee had: but alas he finds it not, he cannot reliſh theſe pleaſures, he hath ſmal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in theſe profits; this credit is a drie credit vnto him, his heart will not reliſh ſuch things as theſe; but ſtill he toſſeth and tumbleth, finding no reſt in his eſtate, nor perhaps power to get out of it: for it may bee, hee cannot bring himſelfe to pray at all,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.3.</note> as <hi>Dauid</hi> could not; for he ſaith of himſelfe, that he held his peace: or if he doe, it's too coldly and faintly to remoue ſo mortall a ſickneſſe. But ſtill as the ſame <hi>Dauid</hi> alſo confeſſeth of himſelfe, he roareth and crieth out all the day long (I cannot but be fully perſwaded, that there he deſcribes his eſtate in the interim betwixt his ſinne, and his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt repentance, for ſome feeble offers to repentance perhaps he might haue before), and ſo now his caſe is a very reſtleſſe and diſeaſefull caſe. <hi>Solomon</hi> (the man that of all Gods ſicke children, I thinke, by ſurfetting caught the ſo reſt ſickneſſe) ſhall witneſſe this. He wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no ſweete meates, but they cloied him in ſtead of comforting him; he profeſſeth of them al, that he found them meere vanity and vexation of Spirit. So when a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:3455:39"/> Chriſtian lies vnder theſe ſpirituall diſeaſes, all his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts are but euen vexation of ſpirit vnto him. When he hath thus almoſt wounded and killed himſelfe, Oh how hee ſmarts and bleedes, and is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled! Indeed he ſtill perhaps is carried after the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the world, ſinne hauing now ſo very much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed againſt him, that he wants power to with-draw himſelfe, and to goe backe; but yet full many a time hee ſighes, and groanes, and lookes towards God, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſpirituall reſt of his former life, and hee finds a very bitter, bitter heart. He is in very great extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and it is euen a pang of death for him to remember, how the caſe ſtood with him once, and how it is now. And in very truth, were hee let alone in this caſe, his ſoule would periſh; the life of grace would die, and hee would proue his diſeaſe mortall. But, Ah hee hath a good Father, who is alſo a good Phyſition, who fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his diſeaſe grow mortall (and that the admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Word in publike will not reforme him, and that the voyce of the ſpirit behind him, is now too weake to be heard by him, though ſtill it ceaſe not to checke him, and to call vpon him, and to make him ſometimes purpoſe to returne againe from this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraying) doth now like a good and wiſe practitioner, adminiſter ſome ſuch phiſicke as ſhall ſerue the turne. Some potion of a bitter croſſe, which the ſpirit ſhall worke withall to make it effectuall, is put into his hand to drinke it: or ſome ſore tentation of Satan, or ſome horrible feare of heart, which opens theſe ſtoppages, purgeth out theſe humours, reuiueth his ſoule; and then wofully moſt wofully, he cries out of himſelfe, laments his exceeding folly, goes to God, hartily confeſſing his ſinnes, and with all rigor paſſing ſentence vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3455:39"/> for the ſame, and ſo continues to mourne and cry, and beg mercy till he finde it; and then ſtriues to make amends for his former not growing, by growing ſo much the faſter for it now. So hee is recouered, and continues to the end; for totally or finally fall away by ſinne, he cannot, becauſe the annoynting of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit preſerueth him: till he be raiſed vp at the laſt day, Chriſt will not ceaſe keeping him: yea to ſaluation is he kept, by the power of that great God that hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opted him to himſelfe for a ſonne: and this ſpirituall life giuen in regeneration, indeed becomes an eternall life; ſicke he may be, dye he cannot.</p>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3455:40"/> beautifull graces;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> In his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</note> knowledge, and faith. Knowledge, I ſay, firſt of God, then of himſelfe; out of which ſpringeth humility as a proper effect of both. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth a new light ſhining within him, inabling him to conceiue with a very ſtedfaſt apprehenſion (not with a wauering, wandring, doubtful confuſed fancy, as that was which he had before) that there is a God, an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and infinite eſſence; his maker, &amp; the maker of all things, moſt wiſe, moſt mighty, moſt true, moſt righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; moſt mercifull, moſt holy, hating ſin with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hatred, and fully bent to puniſh the impenitent ſinner with vnutterable puniſhments; fully reſolued with all louing kindnes to accept of the penitent. And in one word euery way inconceiueably excellent, as being indeed the fountaine of all goodneſſe, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, preſeruer, gouernour of all things, the Father, the Son, the holy Ghoſt, as he hath reuealed himſelf to his Church. The brightneſſe of this light diſcouereth it ſelfe vpon his ſoule ſo effectually, that now hee ſtands vndoubtedly perſwaded of theſe things; which is alſo a principall cauſe of all other the good things, that are begun in him, and ſo is fulfilled in him the word of God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.11.</note> ſaying, <hi>They ſhall all know me from the least to the moſt:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. <hi>17.</hi> laſt.</note> and againe: <hi>righteous Father the world hath not knowne thee, but theſe haue knowne that thou haſt ſent me, and I haue made knowne thy name vnto them, and wil make it knowne.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 17.3.</note> So it begins to be to them, <hi>life eternall, to know the onely true God, and him whom hee hath ſent Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Further, as it were a reflexe of this knowledge, followes an apprehenſion of himſelfe, as of a moſt meane, baſe, and contemptible thing (compared to God) in his very creation; for hee was made of duſt, and came of very nothing: but in this his corruption,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3455:40"/> which came afterwards, as a moſt loathſome vile and abominable creature; becauſe he is (now he findes it) full of wickedneſſe and extreamly ſinful. So growes he more and more to diſ-eſteme himſelfe, and to haue himſelfe in no reputation; yea to be vile and odious to himſelfe, and loathſome in his owne eyes; and by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging his infinite baſeneſſe in compariſon of God, &amp; Gods infinite excellencies in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon of him, he is made truly humble. Secondly, faith is wrought in his mind (for this I conceiue to be the ſeate of it, for it is the vnderſtanding that muſt diduct particular concluſions from generall; and ſo make application of them, wherein conſiſts the very eſſence of faith), faith (I ſay) both in God, and in the word of God. Faith in God, whereby hee is verily perſwaded that God is his God; being inabled in true and ſound maner, to apply to himſelfe the ſweet couenant of God, whereby the Lord hath made himſelfe one with him, he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay with aſſurance of heart, <hi>O Lord my God:</hi> and, <hi>the Lord is my ſhepheard; and my Redeemer liueth.</hi> For in truth, finding the liuely portraiture of the diuine nature in him, how ſhould he but know his father by his image? &amp; this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that God is his, &amp; he Gods, is to him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſweeteſt thing in al the world; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to miſſe which, he had rather chuſe to miſſe his very life &amp; ſoule. The ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger it is, the more cheerfull &amp; happy is he; the weaker it is (as ſometimes it hath its faintings), the leſſe liuely is hee. There is alſo faith in the word of God to bee ſeene in him: out of an experimentall feeling, and certainty of the truth of it, hee is vndoubtedly reſolued that it is from God; and that ſo, as hee is inabled to apply it to himſelfe in all the parts thereof. For hauing beene to him, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, in power,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5.</note> it muſt
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:3455:41"/> needs alſo be in much aſſurance. Before the word of God doth worke ſo mightily, to conuert the ſoule, a man may haue a confuſed opinion of its being true, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp vpon truſt (becauſe in the places, and among the perſons, where he hath receiued his education, it is ſo generally accounted); or elſe wrought by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grace of illumination, inabling the mind to giue a light, weake, and infirme aſſent vnto it; but hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be throughly and infallibly reſolued of the truth thereof, nor that it is from God: and therefore it is ſaid of the ſtony ground, that they beleeued indeed, but withall that the ſeed had no roote in them:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.13.</note> they had a conceit, and a ſudden flaſhing apprehenſion, that ſure this doctrine muſt needs bee true; but they had no ſetled, wel grounded, and eſtabliſhed aſſurance thereof. Onely when the word ſinketh thus into the bottome of the ſoule, and a man hath had ſo liuely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of its wonderfull and diuine working; hee makes no more queſtion whether it be of God or no; then whether the Sunne ſhine, and whether that bee food y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> doth daily nouriſh his body. Wherfore by the inward operation of the ſpirit, and mighty efficacy of the word, being moſt effectually co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uinced of its diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity &amp; truth, he now makes care to apply it in all parts to himſelfe; he laies hold vpon the promiſes, threats, precepts, and makes particular vſe thereof to his owne heart, captiuating his reaſon, ſenſe and all, to the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible certainty and verity thereof: for he knowes that God is the author of it, ſeeing it hath begotten him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to be the child of God. So is his vnderſtanding beautified with theſe two moſt admirable fruits of the ſpirit; by which alſo hee attaineth (as the Scripture calleth it) a notable ſharpneſſe of wit,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 1.4.</note> quickening
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3455:41"/> him to the diſcerning of things ſpirituall and diuine, in ſuch maner and meaſure, as a man of far better wit &amp; more learning, but deſtitute of the ſame help, could not attaine vnto. In the next place his conſcience is alſo quieted with peace,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>2.</hi> In his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> &amp; in liued with conſcionable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Whether conſcience be a diſtinct faculty of the ſoule; or whether alone a particular act of the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding reflecting vpon its ſelfe &amp; its owne actions, with immediate reference to God, I hold it not very need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to diſpute: but here we wil ſpeake of it, as of a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall faculty, by reaſon of the wonderfull power, that it is perceiued to haue in al the ſoule. Firſt then, I ſay, the conſcience of the regenerate proclaimes within him, an eſtabliſhed peace betwixt God and him. For the kingdome of God is peace, ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17.</note> and being iuſtified by faith, (which in nature goeth before this work of regeneration, though in time they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioined) we haue peace with God. Then in truth Chriſt fulfilleth his promiſe of leauing his peace with them;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 14.27.</note> euen ſuch a peace as the world cannot take away from them; and this peace that paſſeth all vnderſtanding, is euen as a guard &amp; a watch to keepe their whole ſoules in quietneſſe &amp; ſafety, though in the world they meete with many troubles and diſquietments. Their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences by this moſt ſweet grace becommeth an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble friend vnto them: It tels them from God, that he is reconciled vnto them; and being calmed from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer raging wherwith it was toſſed, it now makes vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (euen within to the care of the ſoule) the moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing muſicke, &amp; the ſweeteſt melody that is to be heard in all the world. It acquitteth, it excuſeth, &amp; in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name and in the roome of God, it pronounceth abſolution. O vnſpeakable conſolation! This is the peculiar hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:3455:42"/> of the ſanctified, they haue many times tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in their ſoules through this peace of their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, which with a quiet countenance, &amp; a ſtill voice it doth publiſh within in their hearts. And yet in the middeſt of this peace their conſciences are not dead and ſleepy neither; but are ready in a friendly &amp; louing maner to check &amp; controll the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if at any time, in things known vnto them to be euill, they ſhall offend: a good man is ſo conſcionable, that he can in no known thing ſwarne out of the way, but his conſcience will bee tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him of it. Onely this is done in faire termes, not with outragious bitternes driuing him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, as in former times; but with kind &amp; yet earneſt expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, drawing him before God to confeſſe &amp; ſeek par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.5.</note> Thus <hi>Dauids</hi> hart, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, his conſcience, ſmote him, when he had cut off the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment. Thus his hart alſo ſmote him after the numbring of the people, &amp; he went in before the Lord &amp; ſaid, <hi>I haue done excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fooliſhly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10.</note> 
                  <hi>but do away the ſin of thy ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</hi> And though the conſcience (being too much put to it by the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God in their folly) do wax ſomwhat ſharp; yet ſtill it keepeth this note of difference from the vnpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged conſcience, that it drawes them vnto God. So a good conſcience is both quiet, for it promiſeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes; and withall wakefull, for it cals for duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly, &amp; ſteppeth out againſt euery confeſſed euill, yea againſt ſuſpected ones too.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>3.</hi> In his will.</note> In the third place, the will of the ſanctified man ſhewes it ſelfe to be holy, by two graces alſo planted in it. Firſt, it is carried vp to Godward. It longeth &amp; thirſteth after the liuing God, ſo that it findeth nothing in heauen nor in earth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable vnto him. It doth embrace him, and draw vnto him as vnto the chiefe, &amp; (in a maner) the only Good.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:3455:42"/> The being, happines, and felicity of God, is the thing that aboue all things, yea aboue his owne happines he deſireth; the fauour, loue, and grace of God next to that, aboue all other things. Let him enioy the light of Gods countenance, and let corne and wine goe which way they will; he is happy enough, in that God is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and is his Father. So <hi>Dauid</hi> once,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73 25.</note> Whom haue I in heauen beſides thee, and whom in earth with thee? and in an other place, All my bones ſhall cry, Lord who is like vnto thee! Now he hath learned to place his feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in the liuing God. Now apprehending him as goodneſſe it ſelfe, he vniteth himſelfe vnto him by a feruent act of his wil, euen panting after him. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his will becommeth very flexible to the wil of God. It begins to be made one with Gods will, and to be (as it were) carried therein, like a ſtar in its proper orbe; or euen as a man in the chariot, wherein hee hath ſeated himſelfe. His will begins to bee euen ſwallowed vp in the will of God, and to bee nothing but as God will haue it; which is the principall, and a moſt inconceiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able happines which he findeth in this world. If it may appeare vnto him that God would haue ſuch a thing done, he reſolues to doe it, ſay profit, pleaſure, &amp; credit what they can to the contrary. Contrarily, if that hee perceiues the Lord of his life would not haue him to doe ſuch a thing; his determination is that he will not doe it, though he be ſolicited with all the allurements of delight, commodity, &amp; aduancement. In truth, this free and firme diſpoſition of the will to doe the good, and auoid the euill, which God enioyneth him, for Gods ſake; is the very heart and marrow of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and therefore there is nothing which a Chriſtian man more miſſeth, then the worke of his will this way,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:3455:43"/> if it be hindred; and nothing in himſelfe which he doth enioy more, whileſt the motions of it are vninterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. An hearty and vnfained deſire to pleaſe God in all things, is the characteriſticall note (as I may tearme it) of the ſanctified. It is the moſt appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſenſible diſtinction betwixt him, &amp; the falſly-ſeeming ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the hypocrite. Wherfore it is of much importance to finde this grace in ones ſelfe. And ſo are the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our powers of the ſoule framed to the bleſſed Image of God.<note place="margin">

Hee is often ſtirring vp in his owne heart, motions tending to diſcouer vnto himſelfe the beauty and ſweetneſſe of God, his wiſedome, his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, his truth, his iuſtice, and other attributes; and withall alſo the admirable and inconceiueable excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of heauen, &amp; the ſurpaſſing glory and felicity of an other life.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3455:43"/> Pſalmiſt affirmeth of himſelfe, his meditation of God is ſweete: euery thing almoſt that he ſees, ſerueth but to beget in him new formes of apprehending Gods excellencie, which in truth ſhineth forth moſt bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all theſe his workes. A man that knowes a rare ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and hidden treaſure, cannot but euer and a none haue the cogitation of it reuiuing it ſelfe within him: and the Chriſtian hauing the eie of his minde opened to know God, and to beleeue in him, ſees ſuch rich treaſures of wiſedome and goodnes in him; that his minde muſt needs be entertaining him within, by the imagination of theſe things. Wherefore not in ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines alone, but in company, the motions of his minde are aduaunced towards heauen; and other things ſerue but as ladders to raiſe his ſoule thitherward. He is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, euen in the middeſt of other buſineſſes, digeſting in his minde, the excellencies of God: and thinking with himſelfe how good, how great, how wiſe is the Lord God, who hath done this, and this, and this! how excellent is his name through all the earth! how happy is he in the higheſt heauens, where hee hath founded the throne of his glory! yea, how bleſſed a Crowne hath he laid vp for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that feare him, &amp; how plentifull a reward is reſerued for them! when he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth abroad, and ſees Gods workes, and when he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied in other occaſions, he holdeth his inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable conference with himſelfe about his God, and often hath his ſoule prouoked to ſpeake vnto God, and to take him into part of this diuine conference; telling him, as it were with a reuerent boldnes, and wife-like familiarity, how much good hee knowes by him, and how excellent hee muſt needes conceiue him to bee by ſuch and ſuch workes of his. In
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3455:44"/> one word, hee mindeth not onely, not chiefely, the things that are belowe, as once he did; but the things that are aboue, where Ieſus Chriſt our ſauiour ſitteth at the right hand of glory. His meditation is of God and his law and Kingdome continually. In like ſort his memory is hallowed to the remembring of God,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Memorie.</hi>
                  </note> and the things that pertaine to God. He frequently mindeth himſelfe, of that all-ſeeing eie, which in all places attendeth him; and though the Lord as being a ſpirit, be in a ſort abſent from his ſenſes, yet by vertue of this ſanctified memory (which makes abſent things preſent), he offers him vnto his minde as continually ſtanding at his right hand: &amp; beholdeth him in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (euen then when he is farre remoued from all other company), as a narrow obſeruer of his ſecret actions, and an eie-witnes of all his moſt inward and retired cogitations. He puts himſelfe in minde ſtill and ſtill, ſaying, Lord whither can I fly from thy preſence? The Lords eies behold me, his eielids ponder my paths: to him nothing is ſecret, from him nothing can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed; thus (I ſay) he mindeth himſelfe of the Lords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard by him, and repreſents him often to his ſoule, as a witneſſe and iudge of his whole life, yea of his very heart and conſcience. And this excellent vertue of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring God, doth ſtand betwixt him, and the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to ſinne, as it were ſtrong barriers, that doe mightily reſtraine his forward fleſh from committing it. For why? ſaith he to himſelfe, doth not the God of heauen ſee and know and vnderſtand? how then ſhall I doe this wickednes, and ſinne againſt him to his face? Further, his memory ſerues his turne alſo for the things of God. The commandements, threats, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the word, the workes of God, either of mercy or
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3455:44"/> iuſtice, the infinite and eternall reward of well doing, the intolerable and endleſſe puniſhment of irrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſinning, and the like, are alwaies before his eies, and hee makes none end of minding himſelfe of ſuch diuine things, as may frame him to holines. There is a naturall power of memory conſiſting in the ability of retaining, and making repetition of things that one hath heard or ſeene. This ability as following the temperature of the body, the ſanctified man (perhaps) may want, (and if nature haue not beſtowed it vpon him, he muſt want it; for grace doth not adde a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter naturall perfection to the powers of mans ſoule, but alone makes the perfections it hath ſtraite and right, and guideth them to God ward): but that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory which God hath giuen him, he can vſe for the good of his ſoule to godly purpoſes, in all the ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed performances of memory. He can retaine good things, according to that ſtrength of retainement which nature affords him: but that that he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine (and heere indeede he ſhewes his memory to be ſanctified), he hath at hand for the benefit of his ſoule in due ſeaſon: fruitfully recalling it, in the inſtant of tentation, in the very time of neede, when it may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile him to reſiſt ſinfull ſuggeſtions of Satan or the fleſh, and to quicken him againſt his backwardnes and vnwillingnes to duties commanded. So his memory becomes a principall inſtrument of order, both to his heart and to his life: for example; A godly man and an vnregenerate, come both to one ſermon. It is made againſt filthines or couetouſneſſe, or any vice, as it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out. The vnſanctified man may (perhaps) be able to repeate tenne times more, and more orderly, then the ſanctified, (this is a fruit of nature not of grace); but
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3455:45"/> when ſome time is paſt, and that both ſhall be tempted to couetouſnes or filthines; all that, that the vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man could ſo readily repeate, is ſlipt quite out of his minde (as a thing careleſly thruſt into a corner, which a man cannot find when he ſhould vſe it), ſo that he follows the ſin as much, as if he had neuer heard that Sermon: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly man, hath thoſe reaſons &amp; proofes of Scripture which he was able to carry away, inſtantly in his minde repelling ſuch thoughts and ſaying, haue I not heard what a ſinne this is? haue I not beene taught how it diſpleaſeth God? ſo by this his holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, the word of God is auaileable to keepe him from ſinning, or at leaſt after to raiſe him vp to the renewing of his repentance. And ſo you ſee the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a Chriſtian mans memory.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>3</hi> In his affecti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons.</note> Thirdly his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are alſo ſanctified, and ſet in good order by the vertues which the holy Ghoſt infuſeth into him. The principall affections are, loue and hatred, feare and confidence, ioy and ſorrow: All theſe are inabled by the ſpirit of God, with a new power of exerciſing themſelues vpon God, and the things of God; and there are certaine vertues which doe rectifie each of them in their ſeuerall workings. Firſt for loue, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and inclinations thereof are ruled by (that King of vertues) charity, both towards God and towards the children of God. A good mans heart is inclining it ſelfe ſtill to Godward, he finds in his ſoule that he hath ſomething within him bowing and bending his heart to God, and making him euen earne and melt after him ſometimes, and cleaue and ſticke vnto him, in an vnexpreſſible manner: yea the ſweetnes of that loue wherewith he finds himſelfe loued of God, is ſtill pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him vnto God, euen then when (perhaps) he finds
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3455:45"/> the Lord ſomewhat diſpleaſed with him, and carrying himſelfe towards him ſomewhat angerly; as a wife comes towards her huſband, with a kind of melting affection, ſubmiſſiuely but ſtill louingly, when ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth that he is offended with her. In truth the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rectified (as I ſaid aboue) by chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, cannot be well enough ſet out in words; he findeth ſuch a kind of clinging to God, and ſuch an vniting of his heart towards him, that he had rather be depriued of all that is deere to him in the world, then of him: and his ſoule doth ſo ſetledly, ſtedfaſtly, ſolidly, irreſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibly bend it ſelfe to be one with him, that this inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion many times doth ouerweigh and ouer-rule all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inclinations in him; and ſometimes hee cannot but euen breake forth into words, profeſſing ſo much to himſelf, as <hi>Dauid,</hi> I loue the Lord; and calling vpon others, ſaying, loue yee the Lord, wiſhing with all the wiſhes of his ſoule, that himſelfe and all others might more and more loue the Lord. A ſanctified heart ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth affected toward God, euen as the louer doth to the perſon he loueth; and he hath (though not ſo paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate, becauſe the obiect is ſpiritual, yet) as true and as perceiueable a working of his heart to God, as one lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hath to the other: and as to God, ſo he is likewiſe indued with charity to Gods people. The liking of his heart is to them aboue all other men: hee finds his heart mooued with good will to none, ſo much as to the Saints. If he perceiue the beames of Gods image ſhining, that is to him as good, and better then twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeeres acquaintance: yea it ſurpaſſeth all names of blood and alliance; whom he ſees godly, him hee pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth aboue all other men. In truth this charity doth then ſhew its warmth, when almoſt the breath of grace
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:3455:46"/> is choaked by vices of diuers kinds. Though ſome particular breach may cauſe a little iarring of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons betweene a godly man, and another whom hee perſwadeth himſelfe to feare God alſo, yet he cannot but feele his heart to ſtand towards him euen in this iarre. Yea let a Chriſtian man, be at the worſt that euer he can be, and gone as farre backe from his growth in godlines as he can be gone, yet he doth not (as the hypocrite when he falls off) fall on hating thoſe that he ſees to hold out in piety; but euen then he liketh and loueth them, and none ſo much as them, vnleſſe it may be in ſome particular iarre to ſome one: and ſo is his loue ruled. His hatred likewiſe is made a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all hatred, it is ſet on worke againſt ſinne and ſinnefull men: It is as naturall with him to hate wickednes as poyſon, and he cannot but hate it, and find his ſoule as it were riſing and warring againſt it; and for thoſe that loue ſin, he cannot but be out with them. In truth, this hatred of ſinne doth cleaue ſo vnto him, and doth ſo inſinuatingly worke within him, that he cannot but hate himſelfe (againſt that filthy ſelfe-loue which hee finds in himſelfe) when he perceiueth the working of ſinne in himſelfe. And as for wicked men, though he would neuer ſo faine, hee cannot find his heart to be ioyned with them: he muſt be of <hi>Dauids</hi> minde, and hate them that hate God; not meaning that he carrieth the habite of malice againſt them, but this his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (of diſliking and of ſeparating from any thing) that he muſt needs find ſtirring in himſelfe towards a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man, in whom he ſees not the image of God. Now for his affection of feare, that is alſo rectified by the vertue of the feare of God: his ſoule is ouer-awed by a grace, making him that hee dares not ſinne againſt
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3455:46"/> God, as a child doth not dare to offend his father; though hee know well that God will doe him no harme, yet he cannot make himſelfe bold againſt him; for why, hee feares him, and doth apprehend the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing of him, to be ſo great an euill, that he euen ſhrinkes at the conceite of it, and finds his heart (as it were) falling downe at the thought thereof. Therefore though no man could puniſh for ſuch and ſuch ſinnes, yet he cannot aduenture vpon them (though he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth ſomething within him prouoking him, that is, his fleſh), becauſe he knowes not how to anſwere it to God, whom he counts it madnes to be bolde to make his enemie. Yea, and this his fearing of God doth ſometimes worke ſo mightily in him, that it makes him feareleſſe of thoſe daungers which elſe would make him tremble; becauſe hee apprehends them as matters of nothing in compariſon of the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, which aboue all things he feareth. Indeed, if God doe pleaſe to reueale himſelfe any whit terribly, or to ſtirre vp the conſcience, the vnſanctified man, trembles much at Gods preſence; he cannot keepe this paſſion of feare from working, when there is preſent an obiect fit to mooue it; but take away this, and he cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to feare: onely the good man, hath the feare of God ſo habituated in him, that though he find not a ſhaking of his ioints at all times, yet his very heart ſhaketh and trembleth to thinke of offending him, and ſo he cannot be induced to doe it: or if he haue, this feare of his will giue him no peace, till he haue attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned reconciliation. So that it is a feare mixed with loue, making one carefull not to offend, and to ſeeke atonement: not an aſtoniſhing feare ioyned with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, making a man to runne deſperately from God
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:3455:47"/> when hee hath ſinned, and nothing elſe but cry out againſt himſelfe, and his owne miſery. Now for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, heere the Chriſtian finds himſelfe confirmed with ſtrength from aboue, to reſt his heart vpon God in Chriſt, for the obtaining of all good things and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping of all euill. His ſoule hangs to Godward, Gods truth and Gods power are leand vnto (when any thing aſſailes his hopes), as the very pillars and foundations thereof: and if hee haue no friend nor meanes to truſt in, yet he giues not ouer hope; but as <hi>Dauid,</hi> can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort himſelfe in God, becauſe his heart was fixed vpon him. And though this his confidence wants not its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, yet he perceiueth himſelfe to haue gotten a new ſtrength by it, which he was neuer acquainted with before; eſtabliſhing and confirming him in and againſt all thoſe ſhewes of euill, that are ready to offer themſelues vnto his minde. In like manner his ioyes are taken-vp with God, and things heauenly many times. O how much good it doth him, to conſider how glorious the Lord his God is in himſelfe, and how gracious vnto him? and what an vnutterable, and heart-rauiſhing pleaſure it is to him ſometimes to meditate of his full inioying of God heereafter? Theſe things comming to his minde, doe euen ſweetly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his heart, and make his ſoule to open it ſelfe to take contentment in them, ſometimes euen as ſenſibly as in the things that are heere below, and often times more. The vertue of ioy of the holy Ghoſt doth rule his naturall paſſion of ioy, and cauſeth it to be prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by things that are not ſubminiſtred vnto his fancy by his ſenſes; but to his vnderſtanding by his faith. Gods promiſes are ſweete to him, the Kingdome of heauen hath a comfortable reliſh in his ſoule, and he
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:3455:47"/> finds a life indeed, in knowing that his life is hid with Chriſt. Laſtly, his ſorrowes are ordinated by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of godly ſorrow, ſo that ſometimes his griefes doe euen runne towards things ſpiritually euill. Alwaies he maintaineth in himſelfe a being diſpleaſed againſt ſinne, but oftentimes it doth euen ſting his ſoule to conſider how he hath offended his God. And though he doe know himſelfe, out of the daunger of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet the louing of God breakes his heart, and hee can then with a ſtill and quiet mourning, ſigh and mourne, and weepe for ſinne, when he is farre enough from hauing any feare of damnation: and though his griefes this way be not euery day alike in quantity nor inſenſiblenes; yet vſually no day paſſeth him; wherein he doth not ſeeke to draw his heart to a relenting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe for his ſinnes. Though his offences be either vnknowne to the world, or ſuch as the world (if it do know) makes no reckoning of: yet his heart is touched with them, it often doth euen ake and is troubled, when he remembers his paſt or preſent tranſgreſſions: Yea, and hee neuer remembers them, but he would faine haue it ake. Euen as nature hath framed him, ſo that he cannot but grieue at naturall inconueniences if they befall him (for the paſſions are not ſimply at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of the will in their working, but alone in regard of the meaſure): ſo grace doth in ſuch ſort rule his hart, that ſpirituall inconueniences, and chiefely, ſinnes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be troubleſome to him. It is a voluntary ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that he hath for ſinne; a ſorrow not forced vpon him by croſſes alone, but ſought by him when he hath no croſſe to grieue for, oft times: yea, he grieueth for this, that he cannot be better then he is; and it is a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and anguiſh to his ſoule, that hee finds in himſelfe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:3455:48"/> no ſtronger and better growth in godlines. And thus (my brethren) is a regenerate mans heart adorned in al the powers of it: vnderſtanding, will, conſcience, the principall; and imagination, memory and affections, the inferiour. Not ſo perfectly I confeſſe, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vices doe not often ſhew themſelues, interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the working of theſe vertues, and obſcuring and darkening their luſter: but ſo, as that ſtill the Sunne of holines doth breake thorough the miſts of vices, when they be at the thickeſt; and ſhine out againe, in ſpight of ſuch indarkening of them. In an vnſanctified man, theſe graces are not to be found at all, he doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the working of them; he feeles not their weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he deſireth not their confirmation: but the child of God findeth them in himſelfe, and often againe fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the quite contrary; he perceiueth them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be ſtronger ſometimes weaker, and he is truly diſquieted with the vices that are oppoſite to theſe vertues, as with diſeaſes of body; and with the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of theſe graces, as with weakeneſſe of his legs and armes, when he ſhould imploy himſelfe in any worke or buſines. His knowledge of God, is obſcured with ignorance, and often aſſailed with obiections, his faith in God and in his word hath its faintings, his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence feeles ſome prickes of guiltines; his will is not without its rebellious motions, his thoughts are dull to God often times; and his memory is turned to other things with the neglecting of God: his loue is cold, his feare is chaunged into a kind of ſtupidity; his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is ſhaken, his ioyes weakened, and to his ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming little leſſe then dead; and his griefes are euen ſtopped, and the ſtreame of his teares dryed vp or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted: but alacke he finds this ſo to be, and is vexed
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:3455:48"/> at it: he perceiueth it and diſcerneth it with paine and diſlike, and hee can tell well that ſometimes it hath beene otherwiſe with him; and why is he thus now? why is hee ſo altered from himſelfe? Indeed he hath theſe graces neuer ſo plentifully, but that he ſees de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and knowes there ſhould, and deſires there might be more: but yet when grace is a little weakened ouer that it was, he findeth it before long, and ſeekes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it againe to its former, and a ſtronger ſtrength.</p>

It is very neceſſary to know, at leaſt wiſe whither it be poſſible for vs to be ſaued or not. Seeing of this life we haue no further aſſurance then for the preſent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that we know all, it muſt ſhortly haue an end; can it be any other then very madnes, to remaine vncertaine whether there be a poſſibility of our chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging for a better; when change we muſt of neceſſity, either for a better or worſe? It pleaſeth vs not to hang in vncertainties about the things of this world, which are but for the twinkling of an eie: will we make our ſelues ſo fooliſh as to bee content alone not to know, what ill may befal vs heereafter? An impoſſibility of entring into heauen, caries with it a certainty of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into hell: he that cannot enter into the former, cannot but be caſt into the latter. Wherefore againe, and againe I exhort you, ſeeing it is impoſſible to be ſaued without regeneration; know you of your owne eſtate ſo much, whether you be regenerated yea or no. And (my brethren) take heede of ſatisfying your ſelues heere, in a matter of ſo much importance, with wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring conceits, and vncertaine probabilities: let it not ſuffice you to thinke you are borne againe: reſt not ſeeking till yee haue concluded vpon the matter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly one way or other, and can ſay without all queſtion, either I am regenerated; or I am not. In ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truth, the vnwillingnes to enter into this inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, giueth occaſion of vehement ſuſpition that one is not regenerated. It is a ſore preſumption, that a man hath not that grace, whereof he is not willing with any ſeriouſnes and diligence, to examine himſelfe, if hee
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:3455:49"/> haue it yea or no. And let that man, that is willing to put of this matter ſlightly; &amp; to pleaſe himſelfe in idle imaginations, ſaying, I hope I haue beene regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though he haue neuer beſtowed paines to inquire into the grounds of this hope: let that man I ſay, be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen all moſt aſſured, that he is not as yet regenerated. A ſound and well grounded ſcholar feares not be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in grounds of learning; a ſufficient workman in any trade is neuer vnwilling to come into triall and queſtion about his skill: onely bunglers, onely dunces abhorre from all ſearch and triall of their ſufficiencies. A ſecret guiltines of wants, cauſeth an vnwillingnes of being hard preſſed to ſhew what one hath; doubtleſſe it is ſo in the matters of the ſoule alſo. The regenerate is willing to ſearch out his eſtate, becauſe the goodnes thereof doth more cleerely appeare, by how much it is more often ſearched; but he that cannot away to ſtand asking and demanding of himſelfe, and call for infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proofes of his being regenerate, is therefore alone vnwilling to put himſelfe to the trouble of proouing it, becauſe hee is deſtitute of ſufficient proofes.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lſehood of our opinions, it comes to paſſe that we are very ready to be deceiued with ouer-louing opinions of our ſelues. Where almoſt ſhall we find a man (not extreamely and notoriouſly wicked in all manner of ſhamefull abominations), which will not ſay, that hee hopes he is Gods childe, and to be Gods child, and to be regenerate? or almoſt one and the ſame thing, they differ alone in ſome reſpects. Let our readines to brag of being better then in truth we be (a certaine fruit of the blindneſſe of our mindes in the matters of God), let this readineſſe I ſay, to bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwell conceited of our ſelues, make vs afraide to reſt vpon any ouer haſty anſwere to this queſtion, whether we be regenerate yea or no. Before thou do reſt in the anſwere thou haſt to make to this queſtion, looke well to the grounds of thine anſwere, and ſee that thine anſwere be made out of knowledge and iudgement; not out of the folly and blindneſſe of ſelfe-loue. Verily (brethren) I would haue you make a true anſwere this way, and neither deny the worke that God hath wrought in you; nor yet brag of a conceite of that worke which neuer was: but yet let me freely confeſſe thus much, that I had much rather haue you feare without a cauſe, then hope without a cauſe. I would thou ſhouldeſt anſwere truly of thine eſtate; but I had rather thou ſhouldeſt erre in thinking thy ſelfe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, when thou art; then on the other hand in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:3455:50"/> deeming thy ſelfe regenerated when thou art not: for indeede, the former, though it be a troubleſome error, yet is nothing daungerous; the latter though pleaſing enough, is extreamely perilous. Daungerleſſe feare, is better then feareleſſe daunger. If a man condemned to dye, and leading to execution, thinke that he hath a pardon and hath none; he may goe pleaſantly to the gallowes out of this fancy; but he will ſcarce come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it pleaſantly: but if he that hath a pardon, thinke hee haue none; his heart is heauy in going, but he feeles himſelfe lighted quickly, when at the inſtant the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is produced to ſaue his life. Iuſt ſo it is, in this caſe: If any amongſt you be ſtrongly conceited that he is Gods child and is not, hee goes towards death with fewer feares, and is not much troubled at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his laſt houre: but in that houre and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, O then how terrible are his terrors, made by ſeeing himſelfe diſappointed! Shall a man, thinke you, haue any refreſhing in hell, from the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his former conceits, whereby he did account himſelfe the childe of God, which now all too late hee findeth quite contrary? On the other ſide, if the child of God remaine fearefull of his eſtate, and cannot tell what to affirme of himſelfe, but rather conceiueth hee is not Gods child then otherwiſe; I confeſſe he hath many needleſſe feares, many cauſeleſſe diſquietments, &amp; a life far more vncomfortable then he need to haue: but, when after death hee ſhall be receiued, into the inheritance of Gods children, then his former feares ſhall no whit impeach his preſent glory, he is ſafe and happy for all his feare. Much rather therefore would I ſo ſpeake, that you might be fearefull without cauſe, then hopefull: for I wiſh your preſent diſquietment
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:3455:51"/> without your future perill: rather then your preſent caſe with your future deſtruction. This is the cauſe that I dwell ſo much vpon this point, that I vrge it ſo hard, and ſtriue to ſet it ſo neere vnto thy ſoule, aduiſing thee, to aske thy ſelfe once; am I regenerate? and not to beleeue thy ſelfe at firſt (becauſe thou maieſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps quickly ſay, I hope I am); but to demaunde the ſecond time and ſay, yea, but doe I not deceiue my ſelfe? am I ſo indeede? and is not my conceite of my ſelfe groundleſſe? and yet not to reſt in the ſecond an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, but to goe about againe, and to inquire often, and often, ſaying, to thy ſelfe, what am I? a child of God or not? begotten againe or not? where be the reaſons of my taking my ſelfe for his childe? what due proofes can I bring that I am regenerate? what argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſoundly grounded, and gathered from the word of God can I produce, to demonſtrate to my ſoule, that I am tranſlated from death to life? It is good to be ſuſpicious of the well knowne partiality of our owne hearts; it is good to be iealous of our too too palpable guilefulnes in this caſe: and ſo ſhall a thing well done, be more then twice done; and a ſound and and thorough ſearch, breede a ſound and infallible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance. Let me then vndertake the examination for euery of your ſoules at this time; and know, that the Miniſter ſtanding in Chriſts roome, muſt make bold with your conſciences, and muſt ſpeake vnto you with authority, becauſe he ſpeaketh with commiſſion. Say then, thou man or woman, of what age, place, ranke, condition, ſo euer: Doeſt thou thinke it poſſible for thee to be ſaued, when thou dyeſt? and to paſſe into Gods Kingdome, when thou paſſeſt out of this world? Tell me what thou thinkeſt of this matter. If thou an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that thou haſt neuer greatly troubled thine head
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3455:51"/> with theſe thoughts, but taking thy ſaluation for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, haſt buſied thy mind about other matters. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do condemne thee of monſtrous folly &amp; blindneſſe, and aſſure thee, that howſoeuer it goe with other men, yet thou (as yet) art in no caſe to come to heauen. But if thine anſwere be, that thou hopeſt thou both maieſt and ſhalt bee ſaued. Then I demand againe; Haſt not thou heard the words of our Sauiour? is hee not peremptorie and plaine, with great earneſtneſſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, that vnleſſe thou beeſt borne againe, thou canſt not ſee Gods kingdome? wilt thou impute falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to his ſpeeches, yea or no? if no, then tel me, thou that hopeſt to be ſaued: art thou regenerate yea or no? Here lies the maine matter now, vpon thine anſwere to this queſtion all thine hopes muſt depend, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore anſwere deliberately and truly; Art thou regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or art thou not? Like enough to this thou mayſt ſay thou art. But I reply vpon thee, that it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſay ſo: what will it auaile to ſay thou haſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and haſt them not? to ſay thou art in health, and art deadly ſicke? to ſay thou haſt a pardon of thy felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and haſt none? Or to ſay thou haſt been borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and haſt not? Wherefore I call thee againe to thine anſwere, to ſee if thou wilt ſtand to it? Art thou indeed regenerate, or is it alone thy conceit without ſubſtance? Art thou aſſured of it, or doeſt thou alone goe by gueſſes and coniectures? If thou reſt vpon poore and thinne hopes, may I not be bold to charge thee with extreame folly? I am ſure thou wouldeſt call him foole, that ſhould content himſelfe with ſuch ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple euidences in the matter of his lands, or liuing, or his temporall eſtate: how much more doeſt thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the ſame name, that dallieſt with thy ſelfe ſo fondly in matters, whereupon thine eternall eſtate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth?
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:3455:52"/> but if thine hopes be well grounded, ſhew vs the grounds of them, and bring them forth now in ſo due an houre, before God and thine owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Where is thine holineſſe? where is the Image of God wrought in thee? ſhew how the ſpirit, and the word of God haue wrought together, to change thee into a new man: when diddeſt thou ſee and feele (I doe not ſay, hell open before thee, ready to receiue thee; for that <hi>Iudas</hi> ſaw and felt, and yet was neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated), but the filthineſſe of thy nature, thine abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minableneſſe, ſinfulneſſe and wickedneſſe? what fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent and ſtrong deſires haſt thou found of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and ſanctified by the ſpirit of God? Where be thy cries, thy groanes, thy teares, begging reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation at Gods hand, and earneſtly ſeeking vnto him to reforme thy leaud nature? Where is the firme pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of thy ſoule out of the apprehenſion of his grace, to pleaſe him in all things? Where is thy godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, thy departing from all wickedneſſe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing thy ſelfe conſtantly in that that is good? What combates haſt thou made with ſinne and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and with the vnſanctified world? Where is thy growth and proceeding in all godlineſſe? Shew mee the vertues of the inward man formerly declared. Shew mee thy loue and feare of God; ſhew me thine hatred of ſinne, and ſorrow for it: ſhew me thy mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of God, thy thinking of him, thy beleeuing and reioycing in him, and in his word. Are theſe things to be found in thee? Canſt thou approoue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the liuing God and thine owne ſoule, that theſe matters are in thee? then ſtand to thine anſwere, then confirme thy ſelfe in thy perſwaſion, and be thou more and more aſſured, that the ſpirit and word of God
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:3455:52"/> haue begotten thee againe indeed: but if theſe things be abſent from thee, or if thou pleaſe thy ſelfe in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſhadowes and reſemblances, and conceits of them; I ſay vnto thee, thy conceits are vaine, thine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere falſe, and thou art ſo much the further off from being the child of God, by how much thou doſt more peremptorily boaſt of thy being ſuch. Brethren, what ſhould I ſay more? you ſee the neceſſity of this ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into your ſelues: I haue endeauoured to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you in it; continue you now conſtantly, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer giue your ſelues any reſt, till by looking narrowly into your hearts, you haue attained a true and ſure knowledge of your eſtates, and bee able to ſay and ſhew that you are regenerated, yea or not.</p>

To which kind of men I haue two things to ſpeake; the one, to ſhew them their wretchedneſſe, out of Chriſts owne words; the other to beſeech them, that they would be carefull and willing to come out of it. Come hither all yee vnregenerate men, and ſee your hard condition: you know you muſt not liue in this world alwaies: you ſee ſo many dye before you,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:3455:53"/> that you cannot but ſee, (though you refuſe to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it) that death muſt ceaze vpon your perſons alſo afore long. And you haue been wont to flatter your ſelues with hopes of being ſaued, when you die. But now I pronounce againſt you, that all theſe your hopes are lying hopes, and like a broken reed, will but runne into your armes if you reſt vpon them. Either out Lord Ieſus Chriſt did egregiouſly falſifie, when he did ſo vehemently aſſure <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that a man cannot ſee the kingdome of God, vnleſſe he be borne againe: or elſe you haue moſt egregiouſly deluded your owne ſoules with vanitie &amp; lies; when (being vnregenerate) you haue been bold to make your ſelues beleeue, that you ſhould be ſaued. Now for our Sauiour, wee are ſure he affirmeth nothing but what hee knoweth; his words be all pure words, tryed in the furnace ſeuen times; he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is the author of ſaluation, can well enough tell to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he will grant it; you therfore, euen all you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue maintained co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary hopes in your ſelues, haue lied to your ſelues, haue truſted in vanity, haue bin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled by ſin and Satan, haue flattered your ſelues foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly, and ſhall ſurely be diſappointed of your goodly hopes, vnleſſe you take a better courſe then hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I ſay vnto thee that art vnregenerate: Though thou liueſt an honeſt and ciuil life; though thou cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy ſelfe iuſtly and truly towards thy neighbours in thy dealings; though thou giue much almes to the poore; though thou come to Church, and heare the Word, and receiue the Sacraments; though thou haſt been baptized, and profeſſeſt to beleeue in Chriſt; though thou reade the Scriptures, and pray with thy family; yea though thou haue ſome fits of ſorrow for ſome ſinnes; yea though thou confeſſeſt and leaueſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3455:53"/> many ſinnes, and ſeemeſt to take much pleaſure in the companie of good men, and beeſt forward to the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall exerciſes of religion and pietie; though thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt all theſe things (as al theſe things may be done), and yet beeſt not regenerat, thou canſt not for al that, haue any admittance into the kingdome of God. How mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable therefore is thy condition, that looſeſt all thy paines and coſt that thou beſtoweſt in ſome good things, and canſt not bee ſaued by all that thou doeſt? Doubtleſſe euen ſo ſtands it with all your ſoules that are vnregenerate, your beſt works are but guilded ſins; and that that in you ſeemeth faire and louely to your ſelues, and to your neighbours; to God, that ſearcheth the heart, and iudgeth of all things by the heart, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth exceeding loathſome and abominable. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thy wretchedneſſe therefore, thou that art not regenerate: for to ſpeake all in one word, Do what thou canſt, ſo long as thou remaineſt in this eſtate, there is an vtter impoſſibilitie of thy comming to heauen. But you may (perhaps) ſay vnto me; Who be the men, whom I dare charge to bee vnregenerate, and in that name barre vp the Kingdome of God againſt them? I anſwere, Too too great a multitude, and more by farre then wee doe deſire: euen all thoſe that boaſt of their owne vertues, and will needs make themſelues beleeue, that they loue God aboue all, and with all their hearts, and their neighbour as themſelues: that is in a word, That they doe more then euer any of all the Prophets and Apoſtles, or any beſides Chriſt (in the preſent World) ſince the firſt ſinne of <hi>Adam.</hi> All theſe that find in themſelues ſo great ſtore of the loue and feare of God, as that they conceiue, that they loue him with all their hearts, and feare him with all their hearts, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3455:54"/> truſt in him with all their hearts, and repent eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie day, and beleeue in Chriſt as well as the beſt, and haue done euer ſince they can remember; theſe full men, theſe rich perſons, theſe that haue ſoules ſo perfectlie repleniſhed with all graces, that they finde no want of faith, or of repentance, or of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, or of the ſpirit of prayer, or of the loue of God, or almoſt any thing. Theſe that haue no faults in themſelues, they were neuer proud in all their liues, they know as much as any of them all can tell them; and they haue not brought vp ſo many children, they trow, but that they can tel how to be ſaued; that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wronged any in al their liues; and that hope in God they ſhall be ſaued for their good liues and good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. All theſe ignorants neuer vnderſtood, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore onely boaſt of much; becauſe wanting knowledge totally, they cannot know their owne wants. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any amongſt you be ſuch, and out of ignorance ſo well-conceited of himſelfe, let him not pretend to be regenerate. In vaine he claimeth Gods Kingdome, if he be not changed and become another man. Yea, all thoſe, that though they haue more knowledge then to brag thus, yet neuer felt themſelues to haue been the children of wrath, nor were neuer pained with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of their owne ſinfulneſſe. Theſe alſo I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme to be vnregenerate; and ſo remaining, cannot be ſaued. Yea, all that allow wicked thoughts in their hearts, and neuer take care to ſee, and lament the euill conceits of their inward man; but rather ſerue ſinne in the luſts of it, and pleaſe themſelues in thinking of that, which for feare or ſhame they doe not dare to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh; thoſe alſo haue no part in Gods Kingdome, as the caſe goes with them hitherto. Yea, all that makes
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3455:54"/> no conſcience of ſmal ſinnes, which the world doth not take notice of; but paſſe ouer ſuch treſpaſſes, without making any matter of them, or troubling themſelues to bewaile them; theſe haue cauſe to fear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that heauen is faſt locked vpon them. Yea, all that allow themſelues for gaine, profit, or pleaſure ſake, in any one ſinfull acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſecret or open; excuſing, and ſhifting, and turning themſelues into all ſhapes, to make themſelues not to know it to be ſinfull, and labouring not to be moued with the exhortations of the Word, &amp; checks of their owne conſciences: but holding ſtill their reſolution, that that thing they muſt needs do, they cannot chuſe but doe; though their conſciences would willingly checke them for the ſame, were they not by them put to ſilence. All theſe are to number themſelues among the vnregenerate: and ſuch, as if God be, as he is (moſt perfectly iuſt), cannot be ſaued, whileſt they abide ſuch. But moſt of all thoſe that liue in open groſſe ſinnes, and yet flatter themſelues with hopes of doing wel enough, becauſe others liue as bad as they; and becauſe they doubt not to ouer-entreate God, with the repentance of the laſt houre: theſe are fartheſt off from regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and remaine in a dangerous and damnable eſtate; ſo that I doubt not to proclaime vnto them in the name of God, that (ſo continuing) Chriſt ſhall profit them nothing; Chriſt ſhal neuer bring them to heauen. Now therefore if any of you that heare me, do perceiue your ſelues to be ſuch, I pray you lay aſide all your conceits of going to heauen: I pray you ſurceaſe to feede your ſelues with vanitie, and wind; and to make your ſelues ſecure, by making falſe promiſes to your ſoules of that they ſhal neuer attaine. Know thou whoſoeuer, that art an ignorant boaſter of thine owne goodnes; or a man
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:3455:55"/> ſenſeleſſe of thine owne badneſſe, and muſt be diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with all in ſome one darling ſinne, which faine (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth beginning to ſhew it ſelfe to thee) thou wouldeſt not haue to bee counted a ſinne: know thou whoſoeuer that art a worker of iniquity, and putteſt off repentance till the time of ſickneſſe, that thou haſt no part nor portion in this inheritance; that thou art the old Man, leauened with old leauen, and not renewed nor purged; and therefore that it cannot poſſibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall thee, to ſee Gods Kingdome, if Chriſt be true, and God iuſt, ſo long as thou abideſt vnchanged. What ſhould one doe, to make dead men feele their death? If we could ſpeake plainer to you, we would (brethren): for why, we know, that at this very point, your whole happineſſe muſt begin. The vnregenerate can neuer become regenerate, till he firſt perceiue himſelfe vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate. A child of Satan can neuer be made the childe of God, till he feele himſelfe the child of Satan. Our ſpirituall felicitie begins in the ſenſe of our ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all miſery; and therfore we take all this paines to make you ſee your wretchedneſſe, becauſe it is vpon none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conditions auoidable. Open thine eies therefore and ſee; open thine heart, and feele thine vnregenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, thy being in the ſtate of death, thine horrible ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and thy being (as I haue often ſaid, and cannot too often ſay) no better then the very ſonne and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Prince of Darkeneſſe. Will you not ſee? will you not feele? will you hood-winke your ſelues? will you harden your hearts? will ye ſuffer the Diuell to turne you from heeding your owne eſtate, till at laſt it be paſt recouery? I pray you doe not ſo, be not ſo great enemies to your owne ſoules, I entreate you: But what ſhould I goe forward with more words to you? I
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3455:55"/> will turne my ſpeech to God for you: And, O thou Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of life and light, be pleaſed now to remember the end of thine owne ordinances, and make them fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the purpoſes by thy ſelfe appointed. O, open the eyes of ſome one of theſe blind men; inlighten the ſoules of ſome one of them, at leaſt with ſo much light, that they may perceiue themſelues hitherto to haue been voide of light: put into them, at leaſt, that firſt motion of life, that they may feele themſelues hitherto to haue been but dead men, and voide of life: O let not thy word returne empty, but make it effectuall to all, to which thou ſendeſt it.</p>

It were (in truth) a poore comfort to know ones wound, if there were not a plaiſter deliuered withall to heale thoſe wounds. But we come to entreate you to be made the children of God, and to bee begotten againe: and withall, wee come to aſſure you, that you may be ſuch, if you do not reiect the preſent offer of grace. I pray you therefore let theſe words ſinke into your minds, and be you wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling &amp; deſirous to be the children of our heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I hope (brethren) the requeſt will not ſeeme to you vnreaſonable, nor the motion light, and not worth harkening to; when the God of heauen ſues vnto you,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3455:56"/> that be his enemies, to be changed and become his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opted ſonnes. Sure I am, that if a Gentleman ſhould, with the ſame good meaning, make the ſame offer to a poore miſerable beggar, either he would greedily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the motion, or elſe all that knew him, would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme him mad. How much worſe then mad art thou then, which wilt reiect the Lords owne motion, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to become thy Father, and intreating thee to bee willing to be made his child by adoption? you may (perhaps) ſay vnto me, that you do already wiſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſo to bee with all your hearts, but that all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie lies in being made ſuch as you deſire to be. And I anſwere, that if you doe indeed and in truth long and deſire to be regenerate, with a ſetled and firme deſire, and ſtable and confirmed wiſhing of your hearts, that then the greateſt impediment is remoued, and the greateſt difficultie ouercome, and your regeneration is now in a faire forwardneſſe, yea verily, it is already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun; and doe you but cheriſh theſe motions, and it ſhall be perfected. You may (perhaps) make another obiection, and ſay, that it is not in your power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate your ſelues; and therfore it is an idle attempt of me, to perſwade you to become ſuch as you cannot make your ſelues to be: for the Spirit of God muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and who can command that to come vpon him? To which I anſwere, that indeed a man cannot poſſibly regenerate himſelfe, this is Gods act, not his, he is a meere patient in it. But yet I ſay moreouer, that the doctrine of the Goſpell is the miniſtration of the Spirit; and where that is preached, as now it is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt you, there the holy Ghoſt comes to rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate; there he comes with his in-liuing vertues; there he is preſent with his quickning power: and he that wil
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:3455:56"/> not reſiſt the motions and exhortations, that the word and ſpirit of God doe raiſe vp within him, ſhall ſurely be viſited from on high, and ſhall haue the ſpirit of God deſcending vpon him, to make him a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Yea further I ſay to ſuch an one, that God hath appointed certaine things to be done by men, which they that will not refuſe to doe, may doe, and thoſe that ſhall doe, ſhall be regenerated. For there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon worke of illumination, ſo making way for rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, that it puts a power into man of doing that, which when he ſhall doe, the ſpirit of God will migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily worke within him to his quickening and purging. All you therefore that finde your ſelues as yet not to be regenerate, but yet faine would be (for to others it is in vaine to ſpeake, they be not yet ſo farre inlightned as to be capable of regeneration), but all you, hearken and vnderſtand what it is that you muſt doe, that you may be regenerate; and by doing which, you ſhall not faile of receiuing this wonderfull bleſſing of a new life, to be created in you: onely yet with one prouiſo, that you doe not dampe the preſent motions of the word and ſpirit of God with procraſtinations and delayes, with putting off, and deferring till an other time. Nay, you muſt accept of the offers of grace, whileſt it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to day; and know, that nothing doth more harden your hearts, and chaſe away the ſpirit of God from them, then that fooliſh and ſlothful ſhifting off his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, with a purpoſe of ſetling about the worke hereafter, but not yet. Thou muſt take Gods time, and not bid him tarry thy time. It is no reaſon the King ſhould waite vpon the traitor, till he were at leiſure to receiue a pardon. If thou wilt not haue while, when the Lord ſees it fit to make thee a ſweet promiſe of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:3455:57"/> grace: remember the terrible threatning of Wiſdome, <hi>You ſhall ſeeke me and not finde me,</hi>

Goe thou and muſe thus with thy ſelfe; Alas, I ſee moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently, that as yet I am but a ſonne of old <hi>Adam!</hi> there is no thorough change of mine heart, nor of my
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3455:57"/> life, from ſinne to holineſſe; I am as I was borne, and haue not been altered by a new birth: and therefore I am in no poſſibility of being ſaued. This night, if God ſhould (as how know I, but he may this night) take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way my ſoule from me, O I periſh; for out of heauen, the bleſſed Sauiour of mankind hath excluded mee; for thither he tels vs euidently, that none muſt enter that are not borne againe; and O miſerable man, I that am not yet capable of eternall life, and that ſtand in ſuch tearmes with God to this day, that hee cannot both keepe his owne truth, and ſaue my ſoule! What ſhall I doe? what courſe ſhall I take? O could I once obtaine regeneration, then I were ſafe, then I were ſure; then if death ſhould come immediately, I neede not feare it; then were the gates of heauen opened vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee, and then I both might, and ſhould enter in thereto. O that I were regenerate! O that I were borne againe! O that I were a new creature! O that once the image of Chriſt Ieſus were imprinted vpon me! All the goods and honours of this world, would not ſo much aduantage me as holineſſe, if I could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it. But what doe I ſtand wiſhing? I haue beene told that the ſpirit of God is he, who regenerateth his people. Wherefore I wil beg at his hand that mighty and ſauing worke of his ſpirit, and boldly I may doe it: for Chriſt Ieſus hath promiſed to all that thirſt, that if they come,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1.</note> he will make them drinke of the waters of life. Yea, he hath told me, that if we men who are euil, can yet giue naturall good things to our children that aske them; God will much more giue his ſpirit to them that aske it. For his promiſe is, to poure waters vpon the dry ground, and flouds vpon the thirſty ground, and to poure out of his ſpirit vpon all fleſh.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:3455:58"/> Well I am aſſured the word of God is true, and theſe promiſes ſhall be performed to euery one that asketh, that he may receiue; and to euery one that ſeeketh, that he may finde: for the Lord is rich in grace, and giues to all that aske, &amp; hits no man in the teeth. And therefore I will take courage to call vpon him, for that moſt deſireable gift of God, euen the ſpirit of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.

Send thy bleſſed ſpirit into mine heart to regenerate me; for ſo is thy promiſe plainly made in thy word. Thou knoweſt that I cannot make my ſelfe new: O let thy ſpirit come vpon me, and make me to haue a new heart, and a new ſpirit. Lord Ieſus Chriſt, ſend thy ſpirit into mee, which may reſtore mee from this death of ſinne (which now at laſt thou haſt made me to feele) vnto the life of holineſſe.

My brethren, I haue put theſe prayers into your mouthes: learne you to poure them forth, before the throne of grace in ſecret; forget not in ſome ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of words to cry for this beſt of all gifts, and beg ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and if thou canſt not amplifie, yet multiply; if thou canſt not vſe variety of words, yet repeate the ſame requeſt often, and againe and againe; if thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention ſerues not to ſay more, let thy deſire force thee to dwell vpon this 20. times, &amp; rather then faile, twice 20. times. O Lord giue vnto me (a miſerable ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) thy ſpirit of life &amp; grace to regenerate me; for ſo haſt thou promiſed to them that aske; &amp; I aske Lord, &amp; reſolue to continue asking. I certifie you all fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, and by this authority of Chriſt Ieſus committed to his Miniſters, do verily aſſure you, that he who ſo ſeeketh regeneration, ſhall as certainly be regenerate, as God is true of his word; and that is more certaine then the Sunnes ſhining in the heauens, and the earths keeping his owne place. I know that Satan will ſtep forth to hinder you from following this counſell; he will ſtriue to make you careleſſe of it all together, as if there were no neede of begging ſo hard: but I aſſure thee, that he doth but beguile thee. Neuer any man was regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, nor ſhall be (after yeeres of ability to pray) vnleſſe he doe pray for it: for the gift of the ſpirit is promiſed to you that aske, and to none elſe: and by telling thy ſelfe of thy miſery in wanting regeneration, thou ſhalt eaſily ſhake thy ſelfe out of this careleſnes; and bring
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:3455:59"/> thy ſelfe to a care of ſeeking that, which but by ſeeking thou canſt not get; and but by getting thou canſt not be ſaued. Then will the Diuell aſſaile thee with more tentations, and caſt obiections and doubts in thy way, as if it were in vaine to pray; for ſure thou ſhalt not be heard: but beleeue him not; hee is a lyar in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to make thee make God a lyar; for is not the promiſe ſo vniuerſall, as no man is excluded that doth not exclude himſelfe? doth it not runne thus, euery one that asketh receiueth: euery one that ſeeketh fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and therefore ſay thou to thine owne heart, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one why not I? ſure I will aske then, and will not ſpare to ſpeede, by ſparing to ſpeake to God. And that thou maieſt yet more imbolden thy ſelfe, know that God hath tyed thee by a kind of vow to ſeeke to him for the ſpirit of regeneration, and himſelfe to giue it vnto thee, when thou ſo ſeekeſt. For, tell me, art thou not a man profeſſing to be of the Chriſtian religion? Waſt thou not baptized in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt? To what end was this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing; but to aſſure thee, of the ſpirit of God working like water to thy regeneration? Wherefore vrge thou the Lord with his owne ſeale, and ſay, O Lord! what better euidence can I wiſh? Thou haſt giuen me the ſeale of regeneration. O make it to appeare not to haue beene an empty ſigne: Lord, baptiſe me with the Spirit, and with Water; euen waſh me and cleanſe me, by that pure Water of thy holy Spirit; which may ſanctifie me throughout, and make me a new creature. If any doubt ariſe in thine heart, looke thus to the ſeale of the couenant and confirme thy faith: and aſſure thy ſelfe that God will neuer falſifie his bond and ſeale, he will waſh thee according to his couenant ſealed vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3455:59"/> thee by Baptiſme. In very deed (brethren) it is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity to imagine, that all, that are baptized with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are alſo infallibly regenerated: but yet it is ſure, that all ſuch might be regenerated, if conſidering what this ſeale importeth, they would duly and earneſtly ſeeke vnto the Lord for performance thereof. This is that I call vpon you now to do, if already any haue not done it: Let the remembrance of thy Baptiſme with water, cauſe thee to ſeeke to him that can giue the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of the ſpirit; &amp; he knoweth not how to deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe nor his couenant. But (perhaps) ſtill the Diuell may be buſie with thee, and caſt ſome quiddity, and ſubtill cauill in thy way; as ſometimes he hath done, telling thee, that if thou beeſt not, as thou findeſt thy ſelfe not to be, regenerate: thy prayers cannot be heard, becauſe they be not of faith. Thou maieſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere him, that that worke of God in his word, which moueth thee ſo to pray, is a beginning of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ſhall vndoubtedly be perfected if thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to pray; and therefore that thou wilt not be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by ſuch cauils. For thou beleeueſt that God hath ſaid true, when he ſaid, <hi>Ho euery one that thirſteth;</hi> and ſeeing out of a perſwaſion of the truth of this generall promiſe, thou addreſſeſt thy ſelfe to performe the duty whereto the promiſe is made, thy prayer muſt needs be of faith (though of a weake faith), and be no ſinne, but an acceptable ſeruice vnto God. Now therefore (bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) be not diſcouraged for praying for the ſpirit of life to breathe vpon you, by any cauils or obiections of Satan; be not made careleſſe of ſeeking ſo neceſſary a thing, by any fond imaginations that he will put into your minds; be not diuerted from doing this duty, by any worldly buſineſſe that may come betwixt: but

For ſeeing that is the ſeede of immortality, if it be cloſely laid vp in the ground of our ſoules, it will fructifie to life. This law is pure, and it will purifie. It is perfect, and it wil conuert the ſoule, if like a plaiſter it be laid vnto it. Let it be ingraffed into you like a ſcience, and it will change the wild ſap of your nature, and make you able to bring forth fruits of holineſſe. A man then buries the ſeed of the word in his hart, when he doth ponder and muſe vpon it; when he ſets himſelfe ſeriouſly to conſider the truth of it, and to apply it vnto his owne ſoule, taking that, that is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally deliuered, as pertaining to himſelfe in ſpeciall. Now the whole word muſt be thus whetted vpon the heart; not the Law alone, for that of it ſelfe will breed nothing but miſerable terrours; not the Goſpel alone, for that finding the heart vnprepared to receiue it, in ſuch ill ground, will bring forth nothing but the ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king weedes of preſumption: but both the Law and the Goſpell, it ſo being tempered together, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a ioynt worke in the ſoule, by their mutual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they may both produce the grace of ſanctification. So then, if one would be regenerate, he muſt take to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:3455:60"/> himſelf the whole Word of God. He muſt ſet himſelf al alone to muſe of it, ſaying to himſelf, Theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Law giueth to al mankind, &amp; among the reſt to me; theſe curſes it denounceth againſt the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of it, of which ſeeing I cannot deny my ſelfe to bee one, the curſes thereof belong vnto me, and I, alaſſe, I lie vnder them. But the Word of God hath ſhewed me the way of eſcaping the curſe: for Chriſt Ieſus, the Sonne of God, was in our ſtead accurſed, that wee might be free from the curſe and bee partakers of that bleſſing, which was long ſince promiſed in him, ſaying, <hi>In thy ſeede ſhall all the Nations of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> Alſo the Word of God doth plainely declare, concerning al the ſonnes of men,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 14.</note> that they haue done a corrupt and abominable deede, and that none of them doe good, no not one. It ſhuts them all vnder ſinne, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth them al the ſonnes of wrath. But Ieſus Chriſt is become the Sauiour of mankind, and in him his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is well pleaſed, and none that beleeue in him ſhall periſh. Yea, in him is preached remiſſion of ſinnes, and life euerlaſting to all that beleeue in him, and reſt vpon his merits, as vpon a perfect ſatisfaction; and hee doth ratifie all the ſweete promiſes of the Law, to all that beleeue in him, and ſtriue to obey him; ſo that for his ſake, they ſhall obtaine all the good things which the Law promiſeth: but becauſe we are all ſinfull, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beſtow them on vs. I am a ſinfull wretch, I am a curſed creature, I am vnder Gods anger in my ſelfe; but Chriſt Ieſus hath ſatisfied for my ſinnes, he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed a perfect righteouſneſſe for me. I will goe out of my ſelfe, I will renounce mine owne righteouſneſſe and reſt onely in him, euen vpon him onely; in whom (O my ſoule), aſſure thou thy ſelfe to find full remiſſion
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:3455:61"/> and perfect ſaluation, onely ſo be it, thou turne not the grace of God into wantonneſſe; but out of loue to him, ſet thy ſelf to keep his holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements; and take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy neck that ſweet &amp; gentle yoke of his, the bearing of which is the moſt comfortable liberty in the World. Certainly (men and brethren) he that will often renew theſe meditations in his ſoule, and ſee the foulenes of ſin in the glaſſe of the Law, and the ſweetnes and brightnes of Gods free grace ſhining forth in the doctrine of the Goſpel, ſhal ſurely be tranſlated into the image of God from glory to glory. Therefore now reſolue with your ſelues, that you wil find time conſtantly to meditate on the Word of God, and it ſhal not faile to giue light vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your eyes, and life vnto your ſoules.

The mouth of the Miniſter is the Conduit pipe, wherby the Lord doth pleaſe to deriue the ſweet &amp; wholſome wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of life into the ſoules of men;<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20.</note> It hath pleaſed God by the fooliſhnes of preaching, to ſaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that belieue.

I told you mine opinion before of the Word barely read. I cannot eſteeme it quite deuoide of all power to regenerate, where God doth not giue vnto men a poſſibilitie of vſing other
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:3455:61"/> helpe; I ſee not that he ſhould be thought either vnable or vnwilling to worke by this: but where preaching with paines, or coſt may be gotten, there he that to ſaue his labour, or to ſpare his purſe, will neglect it, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be borne againe. Wherefore (beloued) you muſt make high account of this ordinance, you muſt follow it, you muſt be conſtant in frequenting it; that the Lord by the mouthes of his faithful ſeruants, may breathe the breath of life into you. I confeſſe that there is a kind of fine, neate, daintie preaching, conſiſting in wel-ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding words, and ſtreines of wit and humane learning, to ſet out the skill and art of the ſpeaker, and make the hearer applaud and commend him; which a man may well doubt, whither God wil euer bleſſe to the winning of ſoules. Theſe ſelfe-preaching men, that make prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching little elſe, but an oſtentation of wit and reading, doe put this ſword of the Spirit into a veluet ſcabbard, that it cannot pricke and wound the heart; it cannot worke life, by working death firſt; it cannot quicken, by killing before it quicken. But the plaine and downe-right preaching of the Word, by laying it open in plaine termes, to the eyes of the mind; and laying it hard to the very conſciences, by exhortations, rebukes, and comforts, for which it is profitable; euen this foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh preaching, is that that muſt make you wiſe to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Wherefore how much were it to be deſired, that all we Miniſters would follow that, whereby (with fetching leſſe circuits, and taking leſſe vnprofitable, and ſelfe-intended labour) wee might doe more good to men, and bring more glory to God? and, Oh, how much are you to be called vpon, to loue the Word of God preached, to be glad to haue it plainely deliuered vnto you, and with earneſtneſſe preſſed vpon you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:3455:62"/> all quirkes of wit, and guilded ſhewes of mans wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and of gay words? In one word therefore I doe you all to wit, that this preaching is the inſtrument of God, I meane the chiefe and principall inſtrument, by which he is pleaſed to regenerate mens ſoules. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I command you all in the name of the Lord, to loue it, honor it, frequent it, &amp; ſubmit your ſelues to it, as you loue your ſoules-health. But let me adde one ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary obſeruation more in this point. They bee but vncleane beaſts, that doe not chew the cud. If you will haue the Word, which you heare, effectuall, to make you the ſonnes of God: you muſt not be careleſſe and forgetfull hearers; you muſt not let it ſlip from you, as ſoone as it is heard: but you muſt ioyne meditation with it, and after you haue heard, conſider with your ſelues what you haue heard; and ponder vpon it, as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a thing that much concernes you, and lay the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, reproofes, threats, promiſes, and exhortations thereof, vnto your ſoules; ſaying each to himſelfe, I ſee this is a dutie; haue not I omitted it? O yes, I haue! and ſo fall a begging pardon for former omiſſions, and ſtrength for more carefull performance hereafter, and ſo in all the other parts of the Word that may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto you. And (brethren) the Word thus heard in the Church, and thus ruminated, digeſted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted at home, will be a Word of power vnto you, to conuert you to God from the power of Satan. Thus I haue ſhewed you the meanes of being made the ſonnes and daughters of the liuing God. Be they not plaine? be they not poſſible? be they not eaſie? If any of you miſſe of a new birth, is it not becauſe he cares not for it; and in very truth, becauſe he is not willing to accept it? I cal your owne ſoules to witneſſe, and that God, in whoſe
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:3455:62"/> name, and thoſe Angels, in whoſe preſence I haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken theſe things vnto you, that God deſireth not your death, hee would haue you ſaued; hee offers ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hee would haue you renewed; and hee offers the ſpirit of renouation; and if you want it, it is only meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wholly, becauſe you regard it not, and becauſe you will not take his directions in ſeeking it. O thou ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that art vnregenerate! ſee thine vnregeneracie; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be regenerate; call vpon God for his Spirit of grace to regenerate thee; ponder vpon his Law and his Goſpell, the ſeede of regeneration.

But if thou wilt needs ſtand in thine owne light, and out of a conceit of being already in a good eſtate, keepe thy ſelfe irrecouerably in an euill eſtate; or out of ſloathfull negligence, or prophane careleſneſſe, omit to follow the ſound directions, which haue been giuen thee: be thou euer then the child of the Diuell; be thou euer the ſonne of perdition; worke out thine owne deſtruction, and thy blood bee vpon thine owne head: the Lord is free; wee are free, and of thine owne hand alone it ſhall be required.</p>

                  </note> let vs lay open before the ſanctified man, the riches of conſolation, of which the words of our Sauiour doe put him in poſſeſſion. This worke of the Spirit of God, doth him more good, then al the wealth, ſtrength, health, wit, learning, beauty, credit, fauour and grace, that could befall him in the world. For all theſe things fore-named, a man may haue in as great abundance, as this earth could yeeld, and yet bee no whit nearer to heauenly felicitie; yea, bee quite out of all preſent poſſibilitie of attaining it. But ſo ſoone as euer the Spirit of God from aboue, hath viſited the ſoule of a man, and hath begotten in him the image of Chriſt Ieſus; ſo ſoone is he intereſſed into the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Kingdome of God, and hath that riches and honour of heauen appertaining vnto him, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance that cannot fal beſides him. Euery true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian therefore, be he of neuer ſo meane repute &amp; parts, in the eſteeme of others, or of himſelf, is yet a great, and a rich heire, and hath a mighty and large kingdome, by vertue of this birth-right appertaining vnto him: for the excluding of all that are not borne againe, from out of heauen, is a plaine admittance of all them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, to whom this benefit of a new birth hath befalne. The one cannot but be ſaued as well, as the other cannot poſſibly bee ſaued. Seeing if the cauſe that hindreth our entrance into Gods Kingdome bee remoued, we neede make no queſtion, but that our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage afterwards, ſhall be found both certaine and eaſie enough. O therefore that the children of God could ſufficiently vnderſtand their owne bliſſe! that with heartie reioycing within themſelues, and vnfained thankefulneſſe vnto God, they might paſſe on forward
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3455:63"/> towards the fruition of it. Hope of great things in the world doth fill the ſoule with ioy; and men before the attaining of good things, made ſure and certaine vnto them, doe comfortably foreſee, and expect the attaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Let vs doe ſo for things ſpirituall; conſider with thy ſelfe, to what inheritance the Lord of heauen hath pleaſed to adopt thee. Repreſent vnto thy ſelfe, the vnutterable ioyes which are laid vp for thee, and which thou canſt no more bee depriued of, then God himſelfe can faile of truth and al-ſufficiencie: for hee that hath promiſed is faithfull, and will performe his promiſe. The children of God, whileſt they frame their affections according to their preſent eſtate in the world, doe walke heauily and diſcouragedly; at once wronging both God, that hath giuen them ſuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things to take comfort in, and themſelues, that haue receiued ſo certaine aſſurance of ſuch things. Doth it become thee, to whom God hath made ouer the royall inheritance of heauen, purchaſed with the bloud of his owne Sonne, to weare out thine heart with diſcontentment, and to marre thy face with carnall teares? Is not the fulneſſe of celeſtiall glory and riches, able to counteruaile thy meane and afflicted eſtate here? Cannot eternitie outweigh this inch of time; and infinite bliſſefulneſſe, the preſent ſleighthy afflictions? ſurely the ballances are too too vnequall, wherein things of ſo great value, are not of ſufficient weight, to pull downe ſuch trifles. It is nothing in the world, but our being led by ſenſe, rather then by faith; which makes our hearts heauy, and our liues vncomfortable. Let vs but cleare vp our eyes, dimmed with exceſſiue, and cauſeleſſe teares; and we ſhall find matter enough for glorious and vnſpeakable ioyes, euen in theſe tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:3455:64"/> which feele moſt burdenſome vnto vs. Bee thou neuer ſo poore, neuer ſo deſpiſed, wronged, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; yet being regenerate, God is thy Father, Chriſt thine elder brother, heauen thine houſe and habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the glory thereof thine inheritance. Can hee be poore, that hath ſuch riches? deſpiſed, that hath ſuch honour? deiected, that hath ſuch comforts belonging vnto him? To euery ſoule amongſt you, that is able to approue his regeneration vnto himſelfe, I am to ſpeake in the name of the Lord, and to ſay vnto him in this wiſe; That he is not to lay the fault of his troubleſome, and diſcontented life vpon his eſtate, but alone vpon his vnbeleefe and inconſideratenes: for God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen cauſe and meanes enough, of being full of heartie comfort and ioy, in deſpight of all that the diuell, and the world can doe vnto him. Doſt thou not ſee, how frolicke the fooliſh worldling is, if hee haue gotten a few thouſand pounds together? if he haue built him a faire houſe, and purchaſed a good liuing, or two, lying neere about it: and yet in ſuch termes ſtandeth his ſoule with God, that if hee ſhould (as hee may) deceaſe to night, hee were ſure to bee roring in Hell before morning. But thou, to whom Heauen is aſcertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the moſt plaine euidence, and ſtrong aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that God can tell how to make vnto his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a future thing; if thou haue an ill childe, a froward yoke-fellow, a ſicklie bodie, a penurious and friendleſſe eſtate; doeſt ſpend thy time in ſullen diſcontentment, weeping, and wailing, and take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, with little leſſe immoderateneſſe of griefe, then <hi>Rahel</hi> weeping for her children, which would not bee comforted, becauſe they were not. I tell thee the truth in the name of the Lord, this is a great ſinne of thine,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:3455:64"/> and a ſoule ſhame for thee. Is it not a ſinne to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize heauen? is it not a ſinne to imbaſe Gods richeſt gifts? is it not a ſinne to diſ-eſteeme theſe benefits, that paſſe all the eſtimation of all men? and what is this but a diſ-eſteeming, imbaſing, vnderpriſing of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen it ſelfe, to carry thy ſelfe as if the comfort and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city thereof, were not of worth enough, to keepe thee from ſinking vnder the burthen of ſorrow, about earthly matters? Againe, tell me, if thou ſhouldeſt heare of a man that had at the ſame time made two bargaines, by the one of which hee ſhould looſe ſome foure or fiue ſhillings (or pounds ſay); and by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee ſhould gaine ſo many hundreth thouſand pounds: and vpon the former trifling loſſe, ſhould ſit weeping and ſighing, and wringing his hands, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out that he were vndone; though hee knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough what a rich amends his ſecond bargaine had made him. If (I ſay) thou ſhouldeſt heare of ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; what wouldeſt thou ſay to him? wouldeſt thou not ceaſe pitying him; and euen breake into laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, at his ſo ridiculous and abſurd folly, that would needs torment himſelfe without all cauſe, and would not enioy the good that God had offered him? In truth few men would find in their hearts, ſo much as to take compaſſion of ſuch a wilfully-miſerable man. Hearken now then what I ſay; Thou art this man fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken of, and thy carriage is iuſt his carriage: ſo that what accuſations of folly and abſurdneſſe thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt caſt vpon him, the ſame doe (in the trueſt applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things) appertaine to thy ſelfe. Thou haſt two liues, and two eſtates; a temporary, and an euerlaſting. For the temporary, thou haſt indeed (let it be confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) made but a ſorie match: Thy children are not ſo
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:3455:65"/> dutifull, thy yoke-fellow not ſo louing, thy ſtate not ſo plentifull, thy friends not ſo faithfull, as were to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. But for the euerlaſting, thou haſt made a bargain aboue all imaginations gainfull. For God is to thee a moſt faithfull friend and Father; Chriſt Ieſus a moſt deare ſurety and brother; heauen a rich inheritance, all Saints fellow-citizens, and all Angels willing ſeruants; and after this minute of time ſpent in affliction, thou ſhalt paſſe to a ſtate of bliſſe that neuer ſhall haue an end. In truth the gaining of ten hundred thouſand pounds, doth not more exceed the loſſe of two ſingle pence, then theſe thy ſpirituall benefits exceede thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall croſſes; and therfore (I ſay) it is moſt ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſimply done of thee, to paſſe away thy dayes in heauineſſe and ſighing; which thou haſt ſo good and ſufficient cauſe to ſpend in all holy cheerfulneſſe and reioycing. Wouldeſt thou then bee acquainted with the true cauſe of thine vnquiet and vncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble liuing? It is not the multitude nor greatneſſe of thy croſſes; it is not the heauineſſe of thoſe afflictions, that lie vpon thee more hard then vpon other men (as thou art ready to imagine ſo, ſeeking to excuſe thine owne fault); but it is thy carnalneſſe of mind, thy being led all by ſenſe, thy looking only to things viſible here before thine eyes, and not to things inuiſible, prepared for thee aboue the clouds, and kept for thee by a ſtrong and able friend, Chriſt Ieſus, that hath alſo bought it, and paid deare for it. The children of God doe not take paines to make themſelues vnderſtand their own inward happineſſe; they will not finde time enough to contemplate the beauty of that goodly portion, which the Lord hath allotted vnto them; they will not beſtow their thoughts in heauenly meditations: hence
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3455:65"/> their being ouercome of carnall ſorrow; and well may they thanke themſelues for the want of comfort, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they will not open their eyes to looke abroad into the land of comfort. I am ſure if any of vs were ſhut vp in cloſe priſon, for the ſpace of one whole twelue-moneths; and ſhould there be deſtitute of all good at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, lodging, fare, and other comforts; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al were aſſured, that at the yeeres end he ſhould ſurely come out of priſon, and be made a great Prince for all the reſt of his life, which ſhould endure for the ſpace of fortie or fiftie yeeres after: hee would ſcarce feele any trouble in that reſtraint, any griefe in thoſe wants, any diſcontent in that bad vſage: yea ſo much familiarity would his thoughts haue, with the wealth, and honor, wherin he ſhould liue ſo long a time after his enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the impriſonment would ſeeme nothing vnto him; and hee would rather wiſh to lie in priſon vpon thoſe termes, then to liue in his houſe without thoſe hopes. My brethren, ſuch, and none other is your condition. This world is your preſent priſon; and for ſome of Gods children it cannot be denied, but that they doe finde in it ſomewhat courſe entertainment; but it is certaine, that after a little time (perhaps leſſe then halfe a yere, it is (ſure) not many yeers), they ſhall be inlarged; and after their inlargement aduanced to a kingdome ſo farre excelling all earthly kingdomes, in the honour, wealth, ioyes thereof, as gold excells dirt. And this kingdome they ſhall be ſure to enioy; not for fortie or fiftie, nor for ſo many thouſands or millions of yeeres: but euen for all eternity world without end. What doe you then ſowring and imbittering your hearts with thinking vpon the tediouſneſſe of your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, and refuſing to take comfort to your
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:3455:66"/> ſelues in the conſideration of your kingdome? It is therefore (as I ſaid aboue) long onely and meerly of your carnalneſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore ſettle your ſelues to reſiſt carnall ſorrow, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace ſpirituall ioyes; you ſhall finde your labours this way voide of difficultie, and full of ſucceſſe. When thy worldly heart would thruſt thee into the pit of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow, by telling thee of thine hard fare, thy poore houſe, thy little meanes, thy debts, thy wrongs, thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. Stay thou thy ſelfe vp by oppoſing to all theſe, the conſideration of thy new birth, whereby thou art inſtated into an heauenly kingdome; wherein thou ſhalt abound with all fulneſſe of ioyes for euermore; and wherein thou ſhalt bee more happy and bleſſed, then thine owne heart can poſſibly conceiue of, and that for euermore: And then propound the caſe vnto thine owne ſelfe indifferently, and ſay vnto thy ſoule; O my ſoule, looke on both ſides with an vnpartial eye: look to the condition of my body, and eſtate, and take a view of the miſeries that lie vpon me; but look with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to the condition of my ſoule, and ponder well vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the happineſſe that I am admitted vnto; and then be thou but an impartiall iudge betwixt ſorrow and ioy, to whether rather thou oughteſt to encline. I am ſickly, but I am regenerate and ſhall bee ſaued: I am poore, but I am borne againe, and ſhall ſee the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God: I haue few friends, but I am made the child of God, and ſhall attaine heauen. I haue few friends, but I haue receiued the ſpirit of grace to beget me againe to a kingdome immortall, vndefiled, and that fadeth not away. I haue a froward husband, or
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3455:66"/> wife, or a ſtubborne ſonne or a daughter; but I am Gods ſonne or daughter, and haue Chriſt Ieſus to bee mine husband and yoke-fellow. Haue I theſe bleſſings to counteruaile theſe miſeries? and ſhall I pule, and whine, and looke with a ſad countenance, and walke with a dead heart? Nay I ought not; nay I muſt not; nay I will not yeeld to this extreame weakneſſe of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall lamentation. I haue cauſe to be glad, I haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be merry; and in ſpight of all that the worſt yoke-fellow, or worſt child, or worſt eſtate can doe to grieue me, I will be merry, and I will bee glad. O my ſoule reioyce in the Lord, be merry in thy father, and ſhout for ioy in Chriſt thy Redeemer. Thou art begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againe, thou art made new, thou art regenerate: who ſhould be liuely, if not the children of Kings? who ſhould reioyce, if not the heires of Crowns? I am Gods heire, heauen is mine inheritance, and a crowne of glory is laid vp for me, and I will bee glad. Thus you muſt labour againſt the vntowardly griefes of your owne hearts, and enioy the wonderfull bleſſing of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. So muſt you wipe away thoſe vnprofitable teares from your eyes, and clothe your ſelues with the garments of gladneſſe. For it is a wrong to your ſelues, a diſgrace to the good thing giuen, &amp; an ingratitude to God the giuer; if he beſtow pretious benefits vpon you, and you enioy them not. See therefore that your hearts doe not droope, nor your faces looke ſad as in former time; but goe you now out of Gods houſe (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed with the ſweetneſſe of this comfort) vnto your owne houſes reioycing, as once the man did that was healed of the palſie. And if thine heart (after all this) obiect and ſay, Indeed if I were ſure of my regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo of my ſaluation, your ſpeeches were to ſome
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:3455:67"/> purpoſe: but alacke! I want that aſſurance. Why then I anſwere thee, thou haſt other more neceſſary worke then to grieue for croſſes or loſſes, for the vnkindnes of thy yoke-fellow, or death, or vndutifulneſſe, or affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of thy children; euen for this, that thou canſt not tell but that thou maieſt bee in hell (where thou ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore now turne thy thoughts from ſtriuing to put away griefe, and onely labour to change the obiect of it; that by grieuing for thy ſinnes, and by conſidering thy wickedneſſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of life, and ſorrowfull confeſſion of the ſame to God, with humble ſupplications for a redreſſe of all, thou mighteſt at laſt become a new creature, and bee aſſured that thou art ſo; and then ſet thy ſelfe to enioy the fore-named conſolation. Either (brethren) you bee not certain of your new birth, and then you haue cauſe to grieue for things of a more dangerous nature then outward croſſes, and ſo to labour to know your ſelues borne againe; or elſe you bee certaine of your new birth, and then you haue reaſon euen to ſcorne to bee caſt downe at any outward euils, as much as a great rich man will ſcorne to cry for the loſſe of a ſhilling. Wherefore if you be not regenerate, your ſelues ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the former exhortation, to become ſo; if you be, and know it not as yet certainly, ſettle your ſelues to ſearch into your hearts and liues, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the things formerly deliuered, whether you haue found them in your ſoules yea or no, and ſo bring your ſelues to certainty in this point: and if you bee once certaine of it, then apply your ſelues, mangre earth and hell, to liue with glad hearts, and cheerfull
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:3455:67"/> countenances. For once the word of <hi>Dauid</hi> is a moſt true word. <hi>It becommeth vpright men to reioyce.</hi> And (my brethren) that you may the better reioyce, know, that you are to be frequent in practiſing the duty of thankſ-giuing to God, for this mercy of all mercies: I meane, to appeare before him in your ſecret cloſets, and there all alone (with hearts exalted to as much ioy as can be, and inlarged to as full an acknowledgement of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debtedneſſe as is poſſible), to report before him the wonderfulneſſe of his goodneſſe towards you, and to recount the vncountable number of his mercies, in that he hath done more for you, then if hee had made you of baſe ſlaues, abſolute Monarches of the world. The Lord (my brethren) is exceedingly well pleaſed with the ſacrifices of thankeſ-giuing: no offering is better welcome vnto him, then the hearty offering vp of the calues of our lips, ſpeaking good of his name. It doth the Lord good (to ſpeake after the manner of men) to heare his owne praiſes related by them that are deere vnto him, and haue beſt cauſe to know his inconceiueable treaſures of grace, becauſe they haue been plentifully partakers therof. Now the benefits of this preſent life are ſo meane, worthleſſe, contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in compariſon of thoſe of a better life; and by name, of this foundation of all the reſt, (ſo it is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of poſſeſſion and enioyment) a new birth, as that they which want it, can but ſpeake hollowly to God, when they begin to ſpeake of his mercies; and can be but very faint in thankes, how earneſt ſoeuer they may be in requeſts. But the child of God, that hath a right vnto heauen, giuen him at the ſame time that hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Gods child, hee may moſt feelingly expreſſe his apprehenſions of Gods goodneſſe; and vpon occaſion
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:3455:68"/> of this one mercy, magnifie the name of the Lord his God, for all the reſt which become truly and indeede mercies, by meanes of this, and with this. Wherefore I doe againe propound this matter vnto you, as one of the moſt pleaſing and acceptable ſeruices, which in this preſent life you are able, any of you, to performe vnto the Lord; euen to withdraw your ſelues from company and worldly buſineſſes, and with bended knees, and hands and eyes reared vp to heauen-ward, in the moſt ſolemne manner, to confeſſe before the Lord his louing kindneſſe; and to amplifie, as much as your hearts and heads will ſerue, the exceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that his vndeſerued grace, which he hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in making you new creatures, in making you his owne children by adoption. This is better then all ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, better then all nobility, better then all learning, and better then all health. And the receiuing of this one mercy alone (though one ſhould for all other things bee as afflicted, as the world can make him or imagine him) deſerueth more, and more feruent prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, then all the nobility, wealth, wit in the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. Hath God made thee his child? hee hath done more for thee, then if hee had ſet thee in <hi>Salomons</hi> Throne, without making thee his child; and therefore diſcharge the paiment of praiſe for ſo incomparable a mercy; and that fully and without delayes. Eſpecially (brethren) you are to doe this, conſidering that it is (to which end wee began to mention it) a principall meanes of helping you to the enioyment of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which we are about to diſtribute vnto you. For the benefits of God then are made truly comfortable to vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we do turne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the praiſe of God: but when wee forget to returne him his deſerued thankes, then
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:3455:68"/> doth he iuſtly puniſh vs, by taking away the pleaſant reliſh of his benefits out of our mouthes; &amp; by leauing the palate of our ſoules to ſuch an vntaſtfulneſſe, that we ſhall not be able to finde the ſweetneſſe of them: As a mouth that is out of taſte, feeles no content in the moſt ſauourie meate that is. Wherefore put together the honour of God, and your owne comfort; and (that you may haue your ſoules ſo truly rauiſhed with the ſenſe of his goodneſſe, that aboue all carnall reaſon, and almoſt againſt it, you may be glad and cheerfull) ſet your ſelues (as I was about to ſay) in the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne and hearty manner, to tender vnto the Lord this welcome preſent of thankeſ-giuing. Say vnto him, O Lord God of heauen, the King of men and Angels, and ruler of all creatures, and Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt! infinite are the benefits, wherby thou haſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged my moſt vnworthy ſoule vnto thee: For all that I haue, I haue from thee; and all that I ſhall haue, I muſt haue from thee: thou art the onely indefinite fountaine of goodneſſe, from whence iſſue forth all good things to all that enioy good. It is thy wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full goodneſſe that I was borne a man, with vſe of my vnderſtanding and ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I was the ſonne of death, thou haſt made me the ſonne of life: I was an heire of perdition, thou haſt made mee an heire of ſaluation: I was a ſlaue to ſin, thou haſt made me a free-man from ſins ſeruitude, and a voluntary ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to holineſſe: I was vnder the power of Satan, led by his tentations according to his will; I am now vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dominion of Chriſt Ieſus, led by his ſpirit, to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:3455:69"/> doe his will: I was the child of the diuell, and thou haſt made me thy child. O bleſſed change! O happy alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration! I owe to thee my ſoule by many bonds, it is thine (Lord) many wayes: thou madeſt it, thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed it, thou haſt regenerated it; and now (Lord) accept it as an offering of a ſweet ſauour, and accept with it all the hearty praiſes, and vnfained thanks, that a poore vnworthy creature can breathe forth vnto thee. O Lord, this mercy can but bee abaſed by words, thou haſt made me thine owne child by adoption, thy Sonne, O Lord, euen thy Sonne, who art the moſt rich, the moſt high, the moſt renouned, the moſt puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Prince and King; in compariſon of whom all Princes are worſe and leſſe then very nothing. What ſhall I render vnto thee for all thy goodneſſe? thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireſt thankes, thou deſerueſt thanks, and thou accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thankes: and Lord, be thou bleſſed and praiſed with all poſſible thankes. O thou art good, thou art gracious, thou art full of compaſſion, mercy pleaſeth thee: I feele, I feele that thy mercy is ouer all thy workes; and I haue cauſe to ſay by experience, that thy mercy endureth for euer; for thou haſt made mee thine owne child by adoption, which by nature was the child of wrath. O bleſſed be thy great and glorious name for euermore. Brethren, open your mouths wide in thankeſ-giuing, and God will fill them full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; and know that thou canſt not haue a more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſſurance of thy new birth, then if thou canſt feele thy ſelfe heartily moued to giue praiſe to God for it: It ſhall witneſſe to thee, that thou art a new creature, if thou canſt giue many thankes to him that made thee ſo, for hauing ſo made thee.

In truth this I muſt tell you aſſuredly (for I know it to bee as true, as the Lord himſelf is to be truſted of his word), he that once hath this life, ſhall neuer ſee death.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of ranke poyſon: Sinne, I ſay, ſinne; things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull and condemned; theſe are very ſtarke poyſon to the ſoule: Ratts-bane, and Hen-bane, and Mercury, and Opium; yea, the very inward moiſture of a Toade or Serpent, are no more dangerous to the fleſh, then this is to the ſpirit. And when a Chriſtian man begins to yeeld ſo much to the naughtineſſe of his owne hart, that hee takes leaue to allow ſome ſinne in himſelfe, in ſome ſmall degrees; then it ceaſeth not to worke woful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his ſoule, till at laſt it haue cauſed him to breake forth into the groſſe and foule practice of it, and then is he poyſoned indeede; and if the Lord ſhould not come with his phyſick, he could not but bee damned: but howſoeuer, hee languiſheth and is ſicke, he leeſeth the ſenſe of Gods fauour; the deſire of Gods ſeruice; the comforts of Gods Word; and the loue of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt Ieſus. Luſt, reuenge, deceit, loue of money, loue of credit, loue of pleaſure, and all other corrupt affections lodging within (if they once ſo farre preuaile, that a man is willing to follow them, in thoughts and words agreeable to their wicked nature) doe by little and little euen grieue the Spirit of God, and quench the graces of the holy Ghoſt, till after a while, a man falleth into ſome wicked act of ſome of theſe kinds: and, Oh then, the burning, and ſhooting,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:3455:70"/> and ſwelling of the body after the drinking of Ratts-bane, is not more manifeſt in the bodie, then the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable effects of theſe ſinnes are euident in the ſoule. The conſcience begins to accuſe; God is alienated; the hart is hardned; the mind blinded; and ſometimes a man lies long (as it were) in a ſowne, before he can recouer himſelfe by repentance. Wherefore the godly mans care muſt be, to oppoſe the firſt motions of ſinne, to flie the occaſions of euill doing, to be careful of reſtraining himſelfe from the very ſmalleſt degrees of wickedneſſe: for a little ſinne allowed, will bring in a greater; till that come accompanied with the greateſt of all; and that make a man little leſſe then dead the ſecond time. We muſt therefore caſt away the ſuperfluitie of mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſſe (that is, this allowing of ſinne, and pleaſing our ſelues in the occaſions, &amp; firſt degrees of it), if euer we deſire the ſpirituall health and wel-fare of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner man. <hi>Dauids</hi> conceitedneſſe begate idleneſſe; idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe begat adulterie; adultery, murder; and all, a long lying, and deepe ſleepe in ſinne. It is wofull to conſider the miſerable ruines, that haue been made in the ſoules of many of Gods ſeruants, by their careleſnes this way; how weake they haue growne! how their acquaintance with God, their delight in his Word, their comfort in prayer, their deſire of being diſſolued, and their ioy in a godly life, hath been interrupted! and how they haue come to that paſſe, as ſcarce to ſhew to others, or find in themſelues any ſigne of liuing! Perhaps this may be the very caſe of ſome amongſt you, that heare mee at this time: O (if it be) get thee a preſeruatiue; take thee a large quantitie of godly ſorrow; feede vpon the bitter (but wholeſome) hearbs of humiliation and griefe; go and meditate on the threatnings of the Law; on the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:3455:71"/> death of Chriſt; on the lamentable effects that others of Gods people haue found vpon their growing ſo naught: and recouer thy ſelfe againe by hearty confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and humble begging of pardon and of ſtrength. And now all you, that be (as yet) free from ſuch wofull ſickneſſes, be admoniſhed by the miſeries of others; and let not the deceitfulneſſe of ſinne ſo farre preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, that you ſhould giue any allowance vnto it, take any pleaſure in the motions or occaſions of it, or giue your hearts leaue ſo much as to thinke or ſpeake of it, but with deteſtation. Poyſon is often ſweete; but a wiſe man had rather deny to his taſte the delight of ſweetneſſe, then fill his ſtomack with deadly pangs and gripings. Sinne is honey in the mouth, but grauell in the belly. Hidden bread is pleaſant, and ſtolne waters are ſweete: but, O the miſerable agonies which muſt enſue, before the ſoule can bee clearely purged againe, from the remainders of ſuch poyſon! It is a pleaſing thing to dally, to reuenge, to deceiue, to play the glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and the drunkard: but it muſt coſt a man ſo much toile, ſo many ſorrowfull confeſſions, ſo many heauie paſſages, before hee can recouer againe the quiet of his conſcience, and his enioyment of the aſſurance of Gods fauor; that at laſt it ſhall appeare a deare-bought contentment, and an euill penny-worth of delight. No wiſe man will drinke Wine and Sugar, if it haue been firſt impoyſoned with ſome deadly thing: neither let any Chriſtian ſo farre forget the rules of Chriſtian wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as for any paltry pleaſure, or profit, or credit (which lying, ſwearing, whoredome, drunkennes, ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, or any like groſſe ſin, may yeeld vnto him) to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the committing of them. Doubtleſſe if he do, his complaint ſhall bee at laſt as thoſe ſonnes of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:3455:71"/> once ſaid; O man of God, death is in the pot! But to ſurfet is little leſſe dangerous,<note place="margin">

So in the ſoule, it is likewiſe found, that the exceſſiueneſſe of things lawfull, and the vnſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of indifferent actions, doth ſometimes little leſſe annoy the ſoules welfare, then the committing of things ſinfull. Eſpecially if a man doe miſtake, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that thing lawfull or indifferent, which is wicked and ſinfull; and hereupon out of his erroneous iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, lay the reynes vpon the necke of his carnall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: groſſe, knowne, confeſſed ſinnes, doe no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeble the ſoule, and ouerthrow the quiet and ſtrength of the inward man, then ſuch licentiouſneſſe. The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe (I ſay) of things in themſelues lawfull, through the vntimely and immoderate doing of them, is exceeding perillous vnto the ſoule; and often death is little leſſe, then ready to enter in at this window. The ouer-eager following of worldly buſineſſe, when a man, not out of obedience to Gods commandements, and out of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to humble himſelfe by iuſt painefulneſſe in his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: but out of a loue of wealth, and a deſire to grow rich and great in the world, doth ſet his thoughts and hands a worke about the affaires of this life, ſo that hee can ſcarce thinke or ſpeak (with any life or comfort) of any other thing, then this earth; this greedy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall purſuing of worldly buſineſſes, though in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues lawfull, honeſt, and commendable doth vexe the ſpirit, choak the word, diſ-hallow the ſoule, offend God, and wound the conſcience, no leſſe then the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:3455:72"/> of fornication would doe: for this is to commit ſpirituall whoredome with that grand harlot, the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked world. Alſo the perpetuall and vnſatiable vſe of pleaſures and paſtimes (in themſelues, it may be no way ſinfull nor condemnable), yet ſtill purſued with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-vehement affection to them, with an ouer-ſtrong delight in them; when they bee not vſed as meanes of maintaining our health, or fitting our ſelues for the workes of our calling, and (indeede according as the name of recreations beareth) for the refreſhing of the mind, and making it more liuely and chearefull in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things; but are followed for their owne ſakes, out of a loue of paſtime (which is a childiſh, and too baſe a thing for a wiſe heart to bee in loue with), and when there is no conſcionable regard had, of that rich and pretious iewel of time (which no treaſure ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> redeeme): I ſay, the moſt honeſt and lawfull recreations in the world, ſo inordinately followed, without regard of the due end thereof, and without the practice of Chriſtian moderation in them, is no leſſe harmefull to the ſoule, then it is to the body to bee ouer-watched, or ouer-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured. It dulleth the heart, it clogs the conſcience, it ſtoppeth the mouth from praying, it interrupteth all good meditations, and by little and little doth ſteale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the hart from God and godlines; till at the length groſſe ſinnes and preſumptuous, doe come in the neck of lawfull liberties abuſed. The ſame be ſpoken of the vſe of daintie fare, and ſoft raiment, and all other natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall comforts, when the heart begins to bee ingaged to them; when we onely ſeeke our owne ſatisfaction in them; when we forget to demonſtrate in our manner of vſing them, a deniall of the world, and a crucifying of our ſelues to the world, and the world to vs: then they
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:3455:72"/> are dangerous to our ſoules, and doe euen little leſſe then kill vp the new man in vs. O I would that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of many a Chriſtian did not verifie this! Learne therefore to temper your ſelues in things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent; to be moderate in following your calling; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in vſing recreations; moderate in meate and drinke, and attire; and alwaies rather to be ouer-ſparing to your ſelues in theſe things, then ouer-large; rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge thy ſelfe of ſomewhat thou mighteſt haue, then by venturing as farre as euer thou art able, to make thy ſelfe beleeue it is lawfull, to bring thy ſelfe in danger of going a ſtep or two further, and falling into a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it. The moſt wholſome diet is that, that is moſt ſparing; and it is profitable for the body ſomewhat to deny the appetite, and abridge the ſtomacke. Euen ſo it is alſo for the ſoule; and no man ſhall euer bee other then a dwarffe and weakeling in godlineſſe, that will not be drawne to denie himſelfe ſomewhat of his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full liberty: for ſo ſlippery is our ſtanding, ſo weake are our feete, that if we venture to doe all we think law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in theſe kinds, wee ſhall ſurely doe it vnlawfully. I haue told you (brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>), belieue it as a ſure truth, which your experience ſhal iuſtifie, though your tongues may deny: You ſhall not be confirmed in the inward man, if you doe not keepe your ſelues ſomewhat ſhort in outward liberties of the body, about profit, pleaſure, foode, attire, and the reſt of theſe bodily, and ſenſuall matters. O preferre thy ſoule before thy bodie; and make more account of inward ſtrength, then of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:3455:73"/> wealth, credit, or merriment. But laſtly, if a man doe ſtarue himſelfe for want of victuall,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>4.</hi> By being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in religious exerciſes.</note> and pine his body, by neglecting his due meales, it is without all doubt, that he ſhall haue a weake and feeble body. So it is alſo for the ſoule. The Lord that hath ordained bread to make mans heart ſtrong, hath ordained alſo the ſpirituall foode of his ſoule, prayer, preaching, the ſacraments, holy meditations of the Word, and works of God. Theſe are as requiſite for the ſoules increaſe in grace; as meate, and drinke, and cloth, for the bodies proceeding in ſtrength. Now as it often falleth out in the body, that there growes vpon it a certaine kind of crazineſſe and ſtomackleſneſſe, which makes a man to haue no mind of his victuals; and then the longer hee abſtaineth, the leſſe mind he hath to eate, the leſſe abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to digeſt: ſo it commeth to paſſe likewiſe in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man; the ſoule begins to take little content in prayer, in reading the Scriptures, in hearing the word preached, in the receiuing of the holy ſacrament. Theſe things are not deſired, nor delighted in, with halfe ſo much ardour &amp; feruour, as in former time. When the caſe ſtands thus with the ſoule (and likely the comming in of gaine and preferment, by diuerting the thoughts and affections from things heauenly, to things earthly, doe bring the ſoule to this caſe), then it growes weaker and weaker, and often falleth groſſely and palpably. Yea, it commeth to paſſe ſometimes, that afflictions ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard vpon a man, doe euen put his ſoule out of taſt, through the ſowerneſſe and bitterneſſe of carnall ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that hee findeth no appetite to holy exerciſes, (which are the repaſts of the ſoule) nor any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment in them: then grace is in the wane alſo; then all vertues wither and languiſh, and the ſoule fareth like vnto him
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:3455:73"/> that cannot eate is victuals, whoſe very cheekes ſhew it: ſo the outward behauiour and carriage of ſuch a man, being farre ſhort of that heauenlineſſe and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, that once will diſcouer this languiſhing of his ſoule. Wherefore he that would bee ſtrong in Chriſt Ieſus, and in the power of his might, muſt ſtirre vp in himſelfe the Spirit of God which he hath receiued, by conſtancy in holy meditations of God, of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, of his workes, of his attributes; of himſelfe, his mortalitie, his ſinfulneſſe, the ſhortneſſe of life, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of earthly things, the vncertaintie of friends and wealth, and that laſt houre of his life, and that great day of iudgement. He muſt alſo reuiue the ſame grace of God in him, by being feruent in prayer, and by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoking himſelfe with all heartineſſe of deſire, to beg good things at Gods hand, eſpecially the increaſe of al heauenly vertues. He muſt alſo labour to make his hart hot, with earneſt and vnfained thankeſgiuing for all temporall and ſpirituall benefits; eſpecially for the death of Chriſt, and the kingdome of heauen by that deere price purchaſed for him. He muſt gaine all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of hearing the Word preached; and not ſuffer any idle obiection, and fooliſh impediment to hinder him from frequenting it. He muſt digeſt it by meditation, when he comes home. He muſt carefully prepare for the Lords ſupper, by renewing his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and his faith, before he come thither: And thus he muſt feede of all the delicates, that God hath proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for him. No ſo true ſigne of bodily health, nor ſo ſure meanes of outward ſtrength, as a good ſtomack with good digeſtion: No ſo ſure token and certaine meanes of ſpirituall ſtrength and health, as a longing deſire to all holy exerciſes, publike as well as priuate,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:3455:74"/> and priuate as well as publike. By theſe Chriſt Ieſus communicates his graces to vs. The Word that begat vs, will nouriſh vs. The ſpirit of prayer that obtained good things, will obtaine alſo increaſe of them, and ſo the ſoule muſt needs be well liking. Brethren, you all are taught by nature the neede of corporall food, know alſo the neede of ſpirituall; and if thou deſire to haue thy ſoule thriue in ſtrength and ſtature; forſlake not thy meales, cut not off religious exerciſes ſhort, diſpatch not Gods worſhip curſorily, turne not holy duties into matters of faſhion, and formalitie; but doe them, and doe them conſtantly, and doe them heartily, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent not thy ſelfe in doing them, vnleſſe thou find ſome life and courage in doing them. And that thou maieſt thus maintaine in thee an hungry appetite after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of pietie; dip thy morſels often in the ſharpe ſauce, and ſower herbes of humiliation. Looke back (ſo often as thou findeſt a kind of fulneſſe of ſtomacke, and ſpirituall ſatiety growing vpon thee), looke backe vnto the former ſinnes of thine ignorance, conſider thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall miſery and wretchedneſſe, conſider of thy moſt beloued corruption, and addreſſe thy ſelfe to worke ſome ſenſible apprehenſion of griefe for theſe things and ceaſe not ſtriuing, though at firſt thou ſeeme to ſtriue in vaine. It is certaine, that labouring with ones owne heart, to find out his corruptions that lie hidden, and to lament them being found out, will quicken the ſoules appetite, and reſtore a man to ſome liuelineſſe in holy duties; at leaſt will ſo farre forth preuaile, that if he recouer not his appetite; he ſhall remaine ſenſible of this ſpirituall ſtomackleſneſſe, and humbled vnder it, and full of ſighs and groanes, becauſe of it; which at length will cure him without inconuenience. Now
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:3455:74"/> (brethren) let this word of exhortation ſinke into your ſoules. If regeneration be neceſſary to ſaluation, then the growing in the power of regeneration is alſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. Weake things are often ſo obſcured with their contraries, that it remaineth vncertaine, whither they be or no: but that that is ſtrong, will ſtirre and ſhew it ſelfe. Grace may be doubted of, ſo long as it remaineth feeble and infant-like; adde vnto it growth and bignes, and it will be out of queſtion. No man can be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his ſaluation, without edifying his inward man; more then be ſaued, without hauing the new man. If you would enioy your new birth, confirme it; if you would attaine the comfort of it, grow in it. Neglect not the grace of God that is giuen vnto you: now that you are in Chriſt, be ſtrong men in Chriſt: and ſeeing the Lord hath vouchſafed you the worke of his Spirit, giue me leaue to make vſe of the ſweete exhortation of <hi>Paul</hi> to his Theſſalonians; &amp; to entreate you (brethren) to encreaſe yet more and more.</p>

They that are begotten of God, muſt doe their vtmoſt endeauours to beget others vnto God. All things in nature haue an inclination to deriue their owne qualities vnto other things, and to aſſimilate or worke like vnto themſelues,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:3455:75"/> that that comes neere vnto them. Fier makes al things hot, and water all things moiſt: and in nature, nothing is more ingrafted, then the propagation of the kind. Surely this new and diuine nature muſt not be idle in this behalfe; but they vpon whom the Lord hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to beſtow it, muſt labour to be his inſtruments, of conueying it to others. And in truth, what more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable thing can there be in all the world, then to bee the inſtrument of making many to turne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Satan, to the Kingdome of heauen? Doubtles the point we haue proued, doth neceſſarily leade me to this exhortation. Seeing without regeneration there is no ſaluation, O let all that know the neceſſitie, fruite, vſe, of a new birth, labour to haſten the new birth of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo, that ſo they may be furtherances to their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: to which if they haue any degree of Chriſtian charitie, how can they chooſe, but put to an helping hand; although (perhaps) their endeauours that way be miſconſtrued, and they win no thankes, but rather ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred for their labour? A mad man in his madneſſe, is moſt outragious againſt thoſe, that ſeeke his recouery, and will needs force medicines, and good order, and diet vpon him: But no man after his returne to his ſound mind, is (I thinke) ſo worſe then mad, that then he doth not thanke ſuch friends with all his heart, and eſteeme himſelfe much indebted to them for their paines: euen ſo thoſe that are poſſeſſed (as all vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men are) with a ſpirituall frenzie or lunazie, may (perhaps) be diſtempered with choler againſt ſuch as ſeeke their regeneration; that is to ſay, their bringing to a right mind: But if euer the Lord ſhew mercy vnto them, and viſit them with his heauenly gift, they will glorifie God for vs in the day of their viſitation.

                  </gap>ult for a Chriſtian man, not to be forward in ſeeking (according to his place) to help others to the participation of the ſame grace with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.

See you not (brethren) how all heretikes, and ſchiſmatikes, and men of falſe religions, ſtriue to draw others to their opinions and practiſes?

Doubtleſſe the readineſſe of wicked men to poyſon all that come neere them, with the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonfull breath of their errours and diſorders, ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force vs to more forwardneſſe and care, in ſeeking to be Gods inſtruments, ſo far as in vs lies, at leaſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare ſome to their regeneration: vnleſſe wee will bee content, that they ſhall bee truer ſeruants to the Diuell, then we to God; and they more full of miſchiefe, then we of well-doing. But I am perſwaded, that you are already perſwaded, that this is a duty, and that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the abſolute neceſſitie of a new birth to life euerlaſting, doth euen neceſſarily inforce it vpon you: for how can he ſay he loues his neighbour, that will not put himſelfe forward, to helpe him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the way that leadeth to life. Wherefore that the exhortation may not bee fruitleſſe, I will alſo giue you ſome neceſſary directions in that behalfe. All men
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:3455:76"/> therefore conſidered as members of the ſame particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, are either Paſtors, or the flocke committed to them. The Miniſters are appointed by God to make it their maine worke and buſineſſe, to beget men to life eternall, and to nouriſh this life in them. It is their ſpecial calling, to apply themſelues vnto this moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ſeruice to God, and the ſoules of men. Now for priuate men, they are alſo to attend and heed this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice with great care, ſo farre as it may lie in the way of their calling. Wherefore ſome rules muſt be giuen to all men in general, ſome in particular to the Miniſters. The duties that are common to all men, are likewiſe of two kinds: ſome reſpecting all thoſe with whom they may haue any occaſion of dealing withall; ſome ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reſpecting thoſe that are vnder their gouernement.

So <hi>Paul</hi> was bold to propoſe his example to the Churches to imitate: ſo he telleth the husband, who hath an vnbeleeuing wife; and the wife, which hath an vnbeleeuing husband, that they ſhould dwell one with the husband, the other with the wife;<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.16.</note>

And albeit the woman, in regard of neerenes, and perpetuitie of conuerſing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, hath more opportunity to do her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d good this way; yet no queſtion but the like care of godly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, hath the like power alſo to worke vpon bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and neighbours and acquaintance, and is in that name required of euery Chriſtian man. For in truth, the luſter and ſhining of vertue, hath great force to ſtirre vp admiration in the beholders; and to eſtabliſh in them an high opinion of the perſon, in whom they ſee the ſame, and to make them euen wiſh to be found like vnto them: and ſo at length to condiſcend vnto the vſing of the ſame meanes, by which they haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, ſo wonderfull effects to haue been wrought in them. Indeed men deſperately and exorbitantly wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and withall ſo owle-eied, and ſo miſchieuouſly minded, that the ſhining of holineſſe doth exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offend them, and prouoketh in them the ſharpeſt hatred, and moſt vehement malice that can be. But for thoſe in whom the reſtraining ſpirit of God, hath kept downe corruption from ſuch an abſolute preuailing; and ſome common worke of grace, hath planted ſome, either beginnings, or appearances of ſome goodneſſe; they cannot but wonder at the image of God, and highly eſteeme him in whom it is; and bee prouoked
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:3455:77"/> with ſome deſire at leaſt, to ſtriue for the attainement of the ſame excellencies. Yea, for thoſe moſt notorious ſinners, that are habituated ſo ſtrongly in ſinnes and wickedneſſes, that vertue ſtirreth vp hatred and ill will in them: if euer any croſſe befall them, or any trouble of mind, or the like accident, that ſomewhat cruſheth their corruptions, and abateth the power of their luſts; at that time, they cannot but make knowne a ſecret eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that goodneſſe winneth vpon them, and euen deſire to ſeeke ſome comfort of thoſe, whom they think able to afford it. Wherefore it is required of al thoſe, whom the Lord hath begotten againe to life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, that they frame their conuerſation, as beſeemeth the Goſpell of Chriſt, and agreeably to their high and excellent calling; that men beholding it, may glorifie their heauenly Father, and may be allured to a liking of pietie, which is the firſt ſtep towards the working of it. They muſt euen ſhine as lights in the middeſt of a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward generation, being blameles and ſincere, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out the word of life among them: yea, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely commanded, to walk wiſely towards them that are without, becauſe their walking may be a great fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance to the others conuerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They muſt ſhew forth the vertues of him, that hath called them from darknes to light, that their light may helpe to enlighten o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo. They muſt bee patient in affliction, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in bearing wrongs, painefull in doing ſeruice, iuſt in all their dealings, true in all their ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, pure in all their carriage, ſober in all their liues, and vnſpotted in their whole conuerſation. They muſt beare much, and ſuffer long, and be plentifull in workes of mercy, and cheerfull in workes of kindneſſe; and aboue all, ſhine forth in doing good againſt euill,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:3455:77"/> and ouercomming iniuries with good turnes. They muſt ſhew themſelues cheerfull, and amiable, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and heauenly minded; and that they do not ſerue themſelues, but ſeeke the profit and good of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, in charity. They muſt neither be ſo licentious, as to be wonne by company of others, to things that are vnlawfull; nor ſo ouer ſtrict and ſcrupulous, as to bee enemies to the lawfull vſe of lawfull contents. And it is certaine, that that man (which being ſanctified by the ſpirit, doth ſhew forth the fruits of the ſpirit (ioy, loue, peace, temperance, goodneſſe, meekneſſe, and the reſt), and that obſerueth a prudent mediocrity in all things, ſo that hee neither ouerlaſh in vnlawfull things, nor bee too ſtrait in lawfull liberty), ſhal winne to himſelfe an honourable eſtimation in the hearts of them that are not ſtarke naught; and ſhall make them ready to receiue his exhortations, and to ioyne with him in good exerciſes, by which they may at length be made partakers of the grace of God. Wherefore (my brethren) ſee that yee beautifie the doctrine of God; ſee that ye honour the name of Chriſt; ſee that ye be doers of the word, and not hearers onely, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing your owne ſoules. Denie your ſelues, crucifie your luſts, ſerue not your owne bellies, ſeeke not your owne things, but ſhew your holy conuerſation in the meekneſſe of wiſdome. Let thoſe that are not yet rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, behold in you that be, ſomething that may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect them, that may ſtirre them to a good liking, to a care of following, and to a deſire (at leaſt) of being found ſuch as you are; and ſo by working out your owne ſaluation, be helpers alſo to the ſaluation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Secondly, let your tongues be well ordered,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>2.</hi> By good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</note> and your words gratious. Let your lips feede many, let
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:3455:78"/> your mouthes be wel-ſprings of life, and pleaſant and fruitfull trees; the words of which (as it were leaues) may heale many. Although the preaching of the word by the Miniſter, be the chiefe meanes of begetting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; yet there can be no doubt made, but that good communication of priuate men, hath bin, and may be, and (if it were wel vſed) would be effectual to the ſame purpoſe. The preaching that firſt ſpread abroad the Goſpell, was of men by priuate conference ſpeaking to thoſe of their acquaintance, whom they found op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity ſo to teach; as well as by a more publike preaching of Miniſters, Apoſtles, Euangeliſts, and Prophets, taking the aduantage of publike aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. And in this ſenſe it is ſaid of all thoſe, that were ſcattered abroad by the perſecution of <hi>Saul;</hi> that they preached the Goſpell to ſuch as they met: (not all indifferently, but alone the Iewes) vntill at length, ſome of them of Cyrene, began alſo to ſpeake vnto the Gentiles. Now the words of a godly man, tending to conuert others, muſt be of two ſorts, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three. Firſt, inſtructions, I meane a plaine decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſuch neceſſary heads of Chriſtian doctrine, as are moſt vſefull to the working of grace, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and the miſerable eſtate of mankind thereby; of the neceſſity and nature of repentance; of the death and ſufferings, and natures, and offices of Chriſt Ieſus; of the exceeding great danger of ſinning, and of the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe torments of hell; of the certainty of ſaluation to all beleeuers, and of the nature of true faith, and ſuch other like. Theſe a godly man ſhould ſeeke opportunity to fall in ſpeech of; and auoiding all iangling and friuolous diſputes about vnneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary quirkes and quiddities; and forbearing all oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:3455:78"/> in matters of ceremony, and diſputable points in things externall, (wherewith ſome doe onely take vp the time and trouble themſelues, &amp; the Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out edification): I ſay ſhunning, or ſlenderly &amp; light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſing ouer theſe, ſhould bend himſelfe to a more plentifull and ſerious deliuering of theſe points (which are ſo neceſſary, that without them men cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued), according as God hath giuen him vtterance and ability; alwaies remembring to obſerue the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of time, place, perſon: and not to ſpeake in the eares of a ſcorner, that will deſpiſe the wiſedome of his heauenly ſpeeches. O how happily might a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate mans lips ſpread abroad knowledge, if he would thus redeeme the time to holy conference! not as if it were not lawfull to ſpeake of other matters, either of buſineſſe, or for delight; but that the beſt things ſhould not be quite ſhouldred out, &amp; vtterly forgotten. Thus as men ride together by the way, as they walke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the field, as they ſit together in their houſes, they might (without hinderance to their naturall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires) bee buſie in furthering their owne and other mens euerlaſting eſtate. And doubtleſſe that man ſhould be wonderfully confirmed in knowledge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that would thus endeauour to communicate his knowledge to his brethren. Other things are dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by participating; but knowledge is encreaſed by making it common, with a moſt happy and a gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full kind of encreaſe, where both ſides be gainers: and the giuer getteth ſo much more to himſelfe, by how much he giueth more vnto another. Wherefore if thoſe amongſt you that haue knowledge, doe meete with ignorant perſons (as alas the ſtore of them is ſo great, that you cannot chuſe but meet with many), then
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:3455:79"/> open your lips with diſcretion, and let the law of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome be vnder your tongue. Then ſlip gently into ſome one or other neceſſary head of Chriſtian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that may be moſt behoofefull; and from one to an other, till your wholeſome and profitable ſpeeches, haue helped to open the eyes of the blind. Say to thy ſelfe, how can I tell but that God by my meanes, may begin to make theſe ſimple ones vnderſtand wiſdome; and theſe ignorant learne that knowledge, which may in time procure their conuerſion? then let thy loue burne within thee, and ſtrengthen thy deſires ſo farre, till thou haſt broken thorough the bands of ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe, and feare, and other carnall hinderances, that Satan will caſt in thy way: till hauing made it familiar to thy ſelfe to vſe good conference, thou beeſt able to doe it at all ſeaſons, and with all readineſſe. No ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour is hindred, either by baſhfulneſſe or feare, if the company will giue him hearing, to talke of warre, and the diſcipline of warre. The drouer and graſſier will be talking of ſheepe and oxen. The husband-man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keepe his tongue from the plough, and the prices of his corne: Euery tradeſ-man is apt to fall in ſpeech of the commodities or works, that belong to his trade. Shall the Chriſtian and ſanctified man alone, either feare or ſhame, to ſhew forth the riches of his minde, and to be telling of the wonderfull myſteries of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe? I pray you lay aſide carnall feare, and carnall ſhame, and reſolue to approue the goodneſſe of your hearts, by the ſeaſonable wiſedome of your words; and reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber what <hi>Dauid</hi> tels you in the Pſalme; <hi>The mouth of the righteous ſpeaketh wiſedome, and his tongue talketh iudgement.</hi> Secondly, ioyne louing and wholeſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, ſtirring vp one another, and exhorting one
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:3455:79"/> another, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh. Perſwade with the kindeſt and affableſt words thou canſt inuent: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade (I ſay) thoſe, whom thou maieſt hope will bee perſwaded by thee, to reade the Scriptures, to reade o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good bookes of good men; and if thou thinkeſt there be any hope that they will reade the ſame, giue them withall ſome briefe and good writing, that thou haſt found to thy ſelfe moſt beneficiall; eſpecially per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to goe and heare the word of God: ſay, <hi>Come let vs go vp to the houſe of the Lord.</hi> Striue to bring them to a good eſtimation of Gods ordinance of preaching, and to frequent it conſtantly, and take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, of what thou knoweſt they haue heard, to ſtirre them vp to godly ſorrow, and to mourning for ſinne, and to amendment of life. Doe thy beſt to draw them vnto thoſe duties, that haue drawne thy ſelfe, and may draw them to God. Great is the force of louing perſwaſion; it ſtealeth into the ſoule afore a man is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, and taketh footing before he can obſerue it. It leades and guides men with a kinde of gentle vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, to the things that they neuer intended; and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times it alters euen peremptory and ſtomackfull reſolutions. Forget not therefore by theſe goads, to pricke men forward vnto all the good duties of piety, which thou haſt found effectuall to thine owne new birth. And thirdly, let wholeſome reproofes or admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions be intermingled. How truly ſaid he, that called theſe, Pretious balmes? onely let them bee deliuered louingly, and ſeaſonably, in as much priuateneſſe as may be, and with as much gentleneſſe. It is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> precept, Admoniſh the vnruly. Indeed we muſt limit it with <hi>Salomons</hi> limitation, vnleſſe hee haue ſhewed himſelfe a ſcorner: but otherwiſe hee is, and muſt bee
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:3455:80"/> more then ordinarily vnruly, that if he be gently taken aſide and told of a fault, with kind words, ſhall not bee ſomewhat affected for the preſent, and more when hee comes alone and thinkes of it. But chiefly, if a man doe purpoſely betake himſelfe to one with whom hee hath ſome acquaintance, and ſome intereſt in him, hauing formerly prayed to God for aſſiſtance and ſucceſſe; and there in mild and ſorrowfull manner, lay open vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him the greatneſſe of that euill courſe he can proue him to liue in; the danger of it, the diſhoneſty, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creditfulneſſe, the vengeance of God againſt it, and ſuch like; withall, beſeeching the offender to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber himſelfe, and afore it bee too late, to reforme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. If a man (I ſay) ſhall thus doe, he muſt bee a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſcorner (euen one that hath ſetled himſelfe in the ſeat of the ſcornful), that ſhal not be ſomwhat wrought vpon by words ſo ſweetly and wiſely vttered. And thus muſt all regenerate perſons (as they haue occaſion) la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the regenerating of others by good life, and good ſpeeches. Now I ſhew gouernours of families, how they ſhould ſeeke the regenerating of thoſe that are vnder their gouernment.<note place="margin">

                     </gap>uſe will ſerue the Lord.</hi> Now God is ſerued in the family by reading of the Scriptures, and inuocation of the name of God: for ſeeing God hath vnited them into the body of one family, and made them a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon body; therefore he doth require a common ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of them, that they may all ioyne in doing homage to him, to whom all are ſeruants; remembring, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the families, as well as the kingdomes, are curſed,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:3455:80"/> that call not vpon the name of God. Is the Maſter commanded to whet the Law of God vpon his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as he ſits in his houſe? and muſt it not needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that he muſt ioyne with them in calling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that God, whoſe law that is? When <hi>Daniel</hi> did pray in his houſe, it ſeemeth probable to me, that if it had been a priuate prayer of himſelfe alone, no man could haue knowne it, his enemies could not haue found him at it. It was therefore rather an houſhold prayer, then a cloſet prayer; in regard of which thoſe enemies of his did ſeeke an aduantage againſt him. And ſeeing <hi>Heſter</hi> tooke her maids with her in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary prayers ioyned with faſting: wee haue lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reaſon to thinke, but that ſhe tooke them to her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in her daily and ordinary prayers. <hi>Zachary</hi> tels of them vpon whom the ſpirit of grace and prayer ſhould be poured, that they ſhould mourne (and this mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was not without praying) euery family apart, and their wiues apart. Behold an exerciſe of the family a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, from other families; and of each member of the family (the wife put for the reſt ſynechdochically) apart from other members of it. So then, let euery godly man ſtriue to propagate godlineſſe, by performing theſe duties of godlineſſe with his people. Let him make them acquainted with the Scriptures, by an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and conſtant reading it amongſt them;<note place="margin">Catechiſing them.</note> and let him learne them, how to pray for themſelues, by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, and for them all. Secondly, let him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in the principles of religion, teaching them ſome good Catechiſme, according to their capacitie; at leaſt labouring to driue into their heads, the maine points of Chriſtian doctrine; and that in ſuch familiar ſort of queſtioning with them, that they may make him
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:3455:81"/> perceiue they know what they ſpeake. Muſt not chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be brought vp in information of the Lord? and how this ſhould be, if they be not catechized, I thinke no man can conceiue. Is not knowledge as neceſſary for the ſoule, as foode for the body? Doubtleſſe he muſt be void of knowledge that will denie it. How then ſhall he not deſerue to be called worſe then an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidell, that cares not though his peoples ſoules be ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? You all know, that the maſter is inioyned to looke that his ſeruants breake not the Sabbath. Aſſure your ſelues, the law of God puts one part of his duty, for all parts of the ſame kind; ſo that hee muſt as well looke to him, that he know God and his worſhip, as that he doe not prophane his Sabbath. <hi>Salomons</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taught him when he was young. Shee may bee a preſident for all mothers: and the father ſhould bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to be found negligent in that, wherein the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt be forward. <hi>Abraham</hi> commanded his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to keepe the law of God. How ſhould hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to keepe it, if he had not taught it them? God would haue him that was bought with money, circumciſed. Doubtleſſe then, he would haue him alſo inſtructed in the religion of the Iewes, whereof that circumciſion was a badge. In very deed, if this, and the former duty be not done by the maſter, he ſhewes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe little to heed the ſaluation of his family. So that whoſoeuer doth make conſcience of helping his hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold to heauen, muſt leade them the way, by ſeruing the Lord with them, and teaching them his waies. Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the Church.</note> he muſt likewiſe bring them to the aſſembly of God, to heare his word preached, and examine them what they haue learnt and remembred. For if people be at Church and attend not, little ſhall they get by
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:3455:81"/> the word: and if they be neuer demanded what they haue heard, they will not likely attend; but a deſire of not ſhaming themſelues by ſilence to ſuch queſtions, will make them bow their eares and liſten. Indeed herein the maſter muſt conſider the capacity of his ſeruants, and encourage thoſe of meane wits in the little they can doe; and rather draw them to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſomething (who are leſſe ready for that dutie) by louing perſwaſion, then by tartneſſe of ſpeech; and by commending to them the neceſſity of remembring the word, rather then by ſpeeches of diſgrace. And if they cannot remember any thing, yet he muſt not deſiſt to examine, exhort, admoniſh ſtill; for why, this is the beſt meanes that he can doe, to make them marke and obſerue: and hauing done his owne duty, he ſhall bee blameleſſe before God, though they be negligent. And laſt of al, he muſt not forget to pray vnto God, for the regenerating of thoſe vnder his roofe in ſpeciall.<note place="margin">

This the maſter that doth, ſhall finde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe made louing, charitable, patient, courteous to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his ſeruants: for in exerciſing Chriſtian charity towards them, he ſhall be ſure to find it encreaſe. And if he make ſuch particular prayers, either they ſhall be heard to his great content; or at leaſt they ſhall bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by God, as fruits of his charity, as much as if they were heard. If God be glorified by the conuerſion and ſaluation of our children and ſeruants, as well as our owne; and his glory be (as it ſhould be) deere vnto
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:3455:82"/> vs, as wel as our owne ſaluation; why ſhould we forget to beg at his hands ſo profitable a thing for perſons ſo neere vnto vs? Wherefore if thou haſt formerly been behind hand in mentioning thy wife, childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſeruants to God this way; now make it one of thy daily &amp; har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty petitions. O Lord be thou intreated to make theſe my children thy children, &amp; theſe my ſeruants thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants; &amp; let thy ſpirit work grace in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they may be true members of thy family (the Church of the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified), as well as of this my family. But there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth one peculiar thing in behalfe of Infants;<note place="margin">Eſpecially for Infants, to bring them to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme in right manner.</note> that is, not alone to bring them to Baptiſme (which all do as a matter of courſe), but to bring them to Baptiſme with an high eſteeme of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ordinance, &amp; with feruent praiers to God for his bleſſing vpon it, that it may be effectual for their regeneration. Doubtleſſe Baptiſme is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the New birth: and looke what efficacy the Lords Supper hath to feed our ſoules; the ſame (I muſt thinke, vnleſſe I could ſee a difference in the common nature of theſe two Sacraments) hath Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme to the re-begetting. Wherefore it is a moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofefull duty of the parents (not with thoſe publike prayers alone which are made, in, and by the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, being very well and fitly preſcribed in our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie: but) with moſt vrgent prayers at home, to beg of God, that his Infant may bee waſhed with the holy Ghoſt, as well as with water. Is not a New birth worth asking, thinke we? thy child cannot aske; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is thy dutie, as to bring him to be baptized, ſo to ſtriue with God in earneſt prayers that his Baptiſme may become effectuall. For my part (brethren), none errour ſeemes to me more abſurd, then to imagine that the ſpirit of regeneration is included in water, as a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decine in a boxe; or ſo neceſſarily ioyned to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:3455:82"/> as a ſweet ſmell to ſomething that is perfumed: that all which are baptized, ſhould alſo bee inwardly and actually regenerated. But this I hold, that wee ſhould beg the regeneration of each one that is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and preſume him to be regenerate; becauſe wee ſee the ſeale of the new birth ſtamped vpon him. But among other cauſes of the in-efficacy of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I thinke one chiefe, to bee the parents little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of it; that rather doe it as a matter of courſe, then as a thing that ſhall be behoofefull for them, and that they expect Gods bleſſing vpon, for the ſealing vp of regeneration. God is not (for the moſt part, hee is not) importuned as he expecteth to be, for his co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with this ordinance. Many, and many parents come to the baptiſme of their children, or cauſe their children to be brought vnto it, without faith, without feruent prayer, without any care vſed to haue it bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto their children. Many a good man would bee afraid to come to the Communion himſelfe, without ſome ſpeciall calling vpon God for his heauenly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, without ſome ſpeciall care of renuing his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uen of thoſe, that thus make account of the Sacrament of nouriſhment for themſelues, there be, that haue made ſo little account of the Sacrament of begetting againe; that they ſcarce haue made one prayer the more for it, or been any whit the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to lament their owne originall corruption, and their childes, which it hath receiued from them. O how great a bleſſing is it to a Father, to haue his child regenerated euen from his infancy! how great a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for the child to be borne againe, euen ſo ſoone (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt) as euer he is firſt borne! Why ſhould not a man cry mightily to God for ſuch a bleſſing? Hath not the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:3455:83"/> Lord bound vs to ſeeke to his ordinance, and to bring our children to it? Doubtleſſe Circumciſion was no more needfull for Iewiſh Infants, then Baptiſme for ours. Why then, why do not we ſeeke to it according to the worth of it? and cry to him alſo to be mercifull to them and vs, in waſhing them with his ſpirit, and with water. Sure God hath giuen thee good hope that thy child may be regenerate there and then, by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it to the ſeale of regeneration; wherefore doe thou thy beſt endeauour to procure that it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, by begging the performance of what the ſeale imports. Set a day (at leaſt ſome good time) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to ſeeke the face of God, to finde out and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe thy ſinnes, chiefly thine originall ſinne, which thou haſt deriued to thine infant; lament it in thy ſelfe, lament it in and for him; and with the moſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prayers that thou canſt put vp, beſeech the Lord to accept thee, to accept the fruit of thy body, to bleſſe his owne inſtitution to it, to waſh it with the holy Ghoſt, and to beget it to a new life, and to infuſe into it that holineſſe now (by meanes of Baptiſme), which he can as eaſily infuſe into an Infant, as into a man of yeeres. I ſay againe, pray for the regeneration of thy childe, as well as for thine owne nouriſhing; to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the fruit of Baptiſme for it, as to obtaine the fruit of the Lords Supper for thy ſelfe. Both are Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, both Gods ordinances; but the efficacy of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is more neceſſary then that of the Lords ſupper: for if one be not borne anew he cannot bee ſaued, hee may bee ſaued without ſenſible confirmation. And Baptiſme cannot be reiterated, as may the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; wherefore what thou canſt doe but once for thy child, that thou muſt be carefull to doe this once in
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:3455:83"/> the beſt manner; that being well done, it may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then twice done. How ſtrong and full hopes of his childs ſaluation and regeneration might a parent haue, if he would thus win them of God by prayer? the feruent prayer of a righteous man preuaileth very much. Here therfore, if in any thing; &amp; at this time, if at any time; and for this benefit, if for any benefit, ſee that you make your praiers moſt feruent. And ſo much for thoſe duties, which concerne all men to vſe both towards all, and towards thoſe of their owne families, both elder and infants. Now I come to thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the Miniſters of Gods Word eſpecially:<note place="margin">The Miniſter principally, by conſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t and plaine preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> In all the former duties they are bound, to abound aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: for their calling affords them more knowledge, more opportunities, more authoritie. But ſome things they muſt doe, that others may not. They muſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the holy Sacraments; they muſt offer vp publike prayers for, and with the Congregation: they muſt preach the Word conſtantly in ſeaſon, and out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; following Chriſt Ieſus, whoſe cuſtome it was to goe into their ſynagogues vpon the Sabbath day; and ſo to ſpeake, as all wondred at his gratious words. In truth, God would not haue ordained in his Church Paſtors, that ſhould liue of the Goſpell, and whoſe maine work ſhould be to ſtudie, and to grow in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; but that they ſhould be carefull to ſpeake, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemed wholeſome doctrine, euen to ſpeake and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort with all long ſuffering, and with all authoritie. I doe wonder in my very ſoule, how any man dare ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture to take vpon him, the weightieſt office and burthen that can bee (euen the care of mens ſoules), that knowes himſelfe able to doe no more for their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, then a ſchoole-boy of a dozen yeres old might
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:3455:84"/> doe; euen fairely reade them ſome prayers, and a chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or two! Is this the labouring in the Word and doctrine; for which Miniſters are ſpecially accounted worthy double honour? Is this to be a Worke-man, that needeth not to be aſhamed, diuiding the Word of truth aright? Who can hold vp his face before God, and make anſwere to theſe queſtions; ſo as it ſhall not inforce him to confeſſe, that if he will be a paſtour o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſoules, he muſt be able to doe more for the ſheep, then many (perhaps moſt) of the ſheepe are able to doe for themſelues. The conſcience therefore of that paſtour muſt needs beare witneſſe againſt him, that dares reap earthly things, when he cannot ſow ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all? that dare challenge a place of double honour, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not perform a ſingle work. Dareſt thou (whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thou art) for a liuing's ſake ſerue filthy lucre, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturing on that calling which thou knoweſt thy ſelf vtterly vnable to fulfill? Doubtleſſe the time will come, when thou ſhalt wiſh that thou haddeſt rather choſen to haue liued any where then at the Altar, not being able to doe the ſeruice of the Altar; and then of the Goſpell, not being able to preach the Goſpell. O then ſtudy day and night, and by continuall paines, and putting forth thy ſelfe to all laboriouſneſſe; make thy ſelfe able to do that, which by paines-taking (with much prayer to God for a bleſſing) thou maieſt attaine vnto. I entreate thee to conſider the words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt; whoſoeuer is a ſcribe, inſtructed for the kingdome of God (that is, a good and fit Miniſter) muſt not alone haue in his treaſure, but as a good houſholder, bring forth of his treaſure, new things and old. Art thou not Gods ſteward? art thou not Gods Embaſſadour? art thou not Gods fellow-workman?
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:3455:84"/> why doeſt thou not deliuer thine embaſſage? why doeſt thou not diſtribute Gods foode? why doeſt thou not plant and water, that God may giue the encreaſe? Conſider what a waighty duty, what a great honour it is to bee Gods inſtrument for the regenerating o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; to be a ſpirituall father, to haue them our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſons in Chriſt, who are Gods adopted ſons in Chriſt. Happy is he to whom many men, ſome men, one man, oweth his title of Gods child, and his intereſt into Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
